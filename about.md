My name is Daniel Somerville Roberts, I am currently studying for a BSc in Physics at *Imperial College London*. This is my personal website hosted via GitHub Pages.

My [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.url}}/CV/pdf)

This website contains some essays about my personal thoughts, things I find interesting, etc. It also has lab-books from some personal experiments.

Some of my current interests are Geometry, Optico-Mechanics, and Electronics. I am attempting to teach myself some geometry (see notes) and plan to write an essay on 'The Optico-Mechanical Analogy'.

> Also stored on this site are [notes]({{ site.url }}/notes) from my undergraduate degree (BSc Physics) stored on here. These notes were written by my professors, not me. There is also my [reading list]({{ site.url }}/books). I am (slowly) writing reviews of the key ideas from each book - they're mostly non-fiction. There are also linked to articles that I really like.
