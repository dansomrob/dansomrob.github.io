My name is Daniel Somerville Roberts, I am currently studying for a BSc in Physics at *Imperial College London*. This is my personal website hosted via GitHub Pages.

I have [notes]({{ site.url }}/notes) from my undergraduate degree (BSc Physics) stored on here. NB they are my professors' notes, not mine.

I also have a list of some of my [favourite books]({{ site.url }}/books) on here, some have reviews of their primary ideas. There are also some articles I've really liked.
