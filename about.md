My name is Daniel Somerville Roberts, I am currently studying for a BSc in Physics at *Imperial College London*. This is my personal website hosted via GitHub Pages.

My [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.url}}/CV.pdf).

This website contains some essays on some ideas/thoughts. It also has lab-books from some personal experiments I've done in my spare time. [Notes]({{ site.url }}/notes) from my undergraduate degree are stored here as well as a list of some of my [favourite books]({{ site.url }}/books).

Some of my current interests are geometry, electronics, optics, and classical mechanics.

Originally I applied to Imperial to do a four-year Master's course in physics. Due to a variety of reasons I'm now planning to instead complete the three-year Bachelor's course. I plan to enter industry after.
