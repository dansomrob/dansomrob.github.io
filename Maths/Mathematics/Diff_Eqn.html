  <h1>Differentatial Equations</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Differential equations are found in the form
    \[\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)\]
    This is an <strong>ordinary differential equation</strong>. A <strong>partial differental equation</strong> looks like
    \[\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=f(x)\]
    What we have to learn is how to solve them.
  </p>
  <h2>First Order Ordinary Differentatial Equations</h2>
  <p>
     Both equations i've shown so far are first order, we'll look at them first.<br><br>
    \[\frac{dy}{dx}=f(y)g(x)\]
    \[\frac{1}{f(y)}\,dy=g(x)\,dx\]
    \[\int {\frac{1}{f(y)}\,dy}=\int {g(x)\,dx}\]
    Now technically \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is a symbol in its own right so we can't really split it up. But<br>
    after when we intergrate both sides it okay. Proper proof comes much later (more advanced).
  </p>
  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <p>
    \[\frac{dy}{dx}=x\]
    Lets separate the variables first.
    \[dy=x\,dx\]
    Then intergrate.
    \[\int {dy}=\int {d\,dx}\]
    Which gives
    \[y=\frac{1}{2}x^2 + c\]
  </p>
  <h3>Example 2</h3>
  <p>
    Now lets look at nuclear decay equations.
    \[\frac{dN}{dt}=\lambda N\]
    In A-Level we substitute \(\frac{dN}{dt}\) as activity \(A\).<br><br>
    Now lets solve this equation. We'll begin by using separtion of variables.
    \[dN=\lambda N\,dt\]
    \[\frac{dN}{N}=\lambda \,dt\]
    Now if we intergrate both sides
    \[\int {\frac{dN}{N}}=\int {\lambda\,dt}\]
    \[ln|N|=\lambda t+c\]
    Then raising everything to \(e\)
    \[N=e^{\lambda t}e^c\]
    Now if we say \(e^c=N_0\) then we get
    \[N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}\]
  </p>
  <h3>Exact First Order Differentatial Equations</h3>
  <p>
    So far we've looked at exact differential equations - these are few and far between - but easy to solve (maybe).
