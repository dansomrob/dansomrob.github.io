  <h1>Partial Differentiation</h1>
  <p>
    Lets have an equation which instead of depending upon one veriable, depends on two.
    \[y=f(x)\qquad{z=g(x,y)}\]
    In our first equation only x is the input which is mapped by \(f(x)\) to an output, y.<br>
    In the second equation two imputs are mapped to a single output.<br>
    Let's imagine the following equation.
    \[f(x,y)=x^3+2x^2y+y^2+2x+1\]
    We want to keep y constant and only vary \(x\).Then find the rate of change.<br>
    Suppose we use \(y=3\) to hold y constant.
    \[f(x,3)=x^3+6x^2+9+2x+1=x^3+6x^2+2x+10\]
    Now we can differentitate this function. Which easily gives us
    \[3x^2+12x+2\]
    We say that \(f(x,y)\) has been partially differentitated with respect to \(x\). We would use the notation
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+12x+2\]
    Now if we were to do this at \(x=4\) we would get
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+16x+2\]
    Okay, so fae we used a number in place of y, now lets just keep y constant.
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+4xy+2\]
  </p>
  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <p>
    \[\text{find }\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\text{ for }f(x,y)=x^3+x+y^2+y\]
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+1+0+0=3x^2+1\]
  </p>
  <h3>Example 2</h3>
  <p>
    \[\text{find }\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\text{ for }f(x,y)=x^2y+xy^3\]
    Note that we have to use the product rule here.
    \[\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(2xy)=(2x\times 0)+(2\times y)\]
    Which gives us
    \[\frac{\partial f'}{\partial x}=2xy+y^3\]
  </p>
  <h3>Example 3</h3>
  <p>
    \[f(x)=\cos {x^2y}+y^3\]
    We have the use the chain rule to deal with the cosine.
    \[\text{let}g(x)=x^2y\text{ and }f(x)=\cos g\]
    Holding y constant
    \[g'(x)=2x\times 0 + x^2\times 1\qquad{f'(x)=-\sin {x^2y}}\]
    Therefore
    \[\frac{\partial }{\partial x}(\cos {x^2y})=-x^2\sin {x^2y}\]
    This means that
    \[\frac{\partial f'}{\partial x}=-z^2\sin {x^2y}\]
  </p>
  <h3>The Ideal Gas Law</h3>
  <p>
    \[\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}=-1\]
    Let's prove it.<br>
    Let's begin by stating the ideal gas law.
    \[PV=nRT\]
    I'm going to start by replacing \(nR=k\) simply to make it easier to read.
    \[PV=kT\]
    Therefore,
    \[P=kTV^{-1}\qquad{V=kTP^{-1}}\qquad{T=PVk^{-1}}\]
    Which means
    \[\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}=-kTV^{-2}\qquad{\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}=kP^{-1}}\qquad{\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}=Vk^{-1}}\]
    Therefore
    \[(-k)TV^{-2}\times kP^{-1}\times Vk^{-1}\]
    \[=-k\times T\times V^{-1}\times P^{-1}\]
    Subbing \(k=nR\) back in, we get
    \[\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}=-\frac{nRT}{PV}\]
    Going back to the ideal as law,
    \[PV=nRT\]
    \[1=\frac{nRT}{PV}\]
    Subbing this into our equation we find that
    \[\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\frac{\partial T}{\partial P}=-1\]
    Boom!
