  <h1>Partial Differentiation</h1>
  <p>
    Lets have an equation which instead of depending upon one veriable, depends on two.
    \[y=f(x)\qquad{z=g(x,y)}\]
    In our first equation only x is the input which is mapped by \(f(x)\) to an output, y.<br>
    In the second equation two imputs are mapped to a single output.<br>
    Let's imagine the following equation.
    \[f(x,y)=x^3+2x^2y+y^2+2x+1\]
    We want to keep y constant and only vary x.Then find the rate of change.<br>
    Suppose we use \(y=3\) to hold y constant.
    \[f(x,3)=x^3+6x^2+9+2x+1=x^3+6x^2+2x+10\]
    Now we can differentitate this function. Which easily gives us
    \[3x^2+12x+2\]
    We say that \(f(x,y)\) has been partially differentitated with respect to x. We would use the notation
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+12x+2\]
    Now if we were to do this at \(x=4\) we would get
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+16x+2\]
    Okay, so faw we used a number in place of y, now lets just keep y constant.
    \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=3x^2+4xy+2\]
  </p>
  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <p>
    \[\text{find }\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\text{ for }f(x,y)=x^3+x+y^2+y\text{ and }f'(x,y)=x^2y+xy^3\]
