The main take away from this book is signalling theory. Although not directly covered, I'm going to cover it here.

#### Signalling Theory

- russian kgb uniforms to british soldiers
- zero sum game, unlike modern life (positive sum)

#### Counter Signalling

>The nouveau riche flaunt their wealth, but the old rich scorn such gauche displays. **Minor officials prove their status with petty displays of authority, while the truly powerful show their strength through gestures of magnanimity**. People of average education show off the studied regularity of their script, but **the well educated often scribble illegibly**. Mediocre students answer a teacher’s easy questions, but the best students are embarrassed to prove their knowledge of trivial points. Acquaintances show their good intentions by politely ignoring one’s flaws, while close friends show intimacy by teasingly highlighting them. **People of moderate ability seek formal credentials to impress employers and society, but the talented often downplay their credentials even if they have bothered to obtain them**. A person of average reputation defensively refutes accusations against their character, while a highly respected person finds it demeaning to dignify accusations with a response.

>By contrast, the white lawyers he encountered had a knack for portraying themselves as above all that. “**White people have this instinct that is really important: to give off the impression that they’re only going to do the really important work. You’re a quarterback**. It’s a kind of arrogance that Asians are trained not to have. Someone told me not long after I moved to New York that **in order to succeed, you have to understand which rules you’re supposed to break. If you break the wrong rules, you’re finished. And so the easiest thing to do is follow all the rules. But then you consign yourself to a lower status. The real trick is understanding what rules are not meant for you.**”
