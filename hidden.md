<h1>My first two terms at Imperial</h1>

<h3>Looking Back: School</h3>
*Easter 2022*

Looking back at my school time, I was very privileged. I grew up in the nicest part of the North East and went to the best school in the North East.

I remember talking to my parents about how lucky I was. My dad disagreed. He said many of the things I viewed as lucky were due to my parents making intelligent decisions. Now I agree with him. I hope to be able to do the same with my children.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did very little work at school. I was able to waltz through most exams.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did lots of extra-curricular activities and I'm proud of that.

I'm glad of the time in school. I think it was reasonably well used.

<h3>Winter Term</h3>

A good term.

One change is that I've stopped climbing. I've taken up new sports (jitsu and lacrosse). I'm not a massive fan of the people who do climbing. Agi and Waldo have also stopped climbing. It is no longer cool.

<h3>Spring Term</h3>

This term was bad! There are two major failures this term: diet and sociability.

At the start of the term we sat the M&R exam. At the time I thought it went horrifically.

My diet this term has been poor. I have been eating mostly ultra-processed foods.

<h3>The Future: Summer Term</h3>

>students from less privileged families are more likely to believe that extracurricular activities are irrelevant to their job prospects because what employers really care about are grades, tangible skills, and prior employment experiences and invest their time accordingly.

>Ironically, working-class students’ focus on academics (rather than social and extracurricular activities) while in school constrains, not expands, the types of jobs and incomes available to them when they graduate.

>>Mao began to study the racially inflected social hierarchies at Stuyvesant, where, in a survey undertaken by the student newspaper this year, slightly more than half of the respondents reported that their friends came from within their own ethnic group. His attention focused on the mostly white (and Manhattan-dwelling) group whose members seemed able to manage the crushing workload while still remaining socially active. “The general gist of most high-school movies is that the pretty cheerleader gets with the big dumb jock, and the nerd is left to bide his time in loneliness. But at some point in the future,” he says, “the nerd is going to rule the world, and the dumb jock is going to work in a carwash.

>>“At Stuy, it’s completely different: If you looked at the pinnacle, the girls and the guys are not only good-looking and socially affable, they also get the best grades and star in the school plays and win election to student government. It all converges at the top. It’s like training for high society. It was jarring for us Chinese kids. You got the sense that you had to study hard, but it wasn’t enough.”

>>Mao was becoming clued in to the fact that there was another hierarchy behind the official one that explained why others were getting what he never had—“a high-school sweetheart” figured prominently on this list—and that this mysterious hierarchy was going to determine what happened to him in life. “You realize there are things you really don’t understand about courtship or just acting in a certain way. Things that somehow come naturally to people who go to school in the suburbs and have parents who are culturally assimilated.” I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had “sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble.” This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge “about social norms and propriety” had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.

I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what were doing.

Ultimately there are two major life goals: family and work. I want to avoid setting goals as every time I've tried this I've failed. Instead I want to focus on systems and build these into my identity.

There are some positive things that have happened to build one so far. I enjoy playing lacrosse and jitsu, improving both is important.

**Jitsu**

The role of president for jitsu is great. I want to be the best president for quite a few years.

**Lacrosse**

There is lots of popular chit-chat about habits that are good for you (gym, etc.). However more fundamental is changing your personality.

During the first term of lacrosse, the captain (Ash) told us about how he started lacrosse at university. He described how about halfway through the term he went from it being a chore to go to training to being excited to go. I believe that he changed to include lacrosse as part of his personality.

This is when peer pressure can actually be positive. I have felt this multiple times so far. There have been multiple times where I don't really want to go to training but I end up going due to peer pressure I've put myself under. By telling friends and family that I was playing lacrosse, deciding no to go was a failure. And I didn't to be seen failing. Therefore I always ended up going.

I also always enjoyed the training sessions - and often could feel myself improving. However getting to the session was difficult. I want to begin going to S&C on Fridays and Sports Nights every Wednesday and get further into the sport.

At the end of the term I began doing wall-ball quite a bit. I also want to start skipping to improve footwork. Also strength.

>Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits. James Clear

>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

>Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.

>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
