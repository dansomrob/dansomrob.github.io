# Aims & Goals

*Easter 2022*

>The hardest thing is not doing what you want - it's knowing what you want. [@Naval](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1514833143294877700)

This is a vague, self-exploratory essay looking at purpose & meaning. I want to guide me to figure out what I want to do with my life and my next few years at Imperial.

>'Education was a substitute for thinking about your future' Thiel

### Introduction

Over the very long term, there are two main parts to your life. **Your job** & **your family**. Your job is how you meaningfully contribute to society. Your family is what keeps the human population alive in future generations.

I want to avoid setting goals as every time I've tried this I've failed. Instead I want to focus on who I cant to become (identity).

### My Anti-Goals

Some things I know I don't every want to happen to me are

* Get divorced
* Get fat

Lots of my family has put on the pounds, I would like to avoid this. I also want to avoid getting divorced, it has a major negative impact on children.

### My Future Career

I like to tell people I am studying physics 'because it makes me sound smart'. I don't know what occupation I'd like to go into. I know that I don't want to do PhD.

>From time to time I meet with a youth in whom I can wish for no alteration or improvement, only I am sorry to see how often his nature makes him quite ready to swim with the stream of the time; and it is on this that I would always insist, that man in his fragile boat has the rudder placed in his hand, just that he may not be at the mercy of the waves, but follow the direction of his own insight. Goethe

wealth has only a trivial effect on happiness unless we have more than those around us, suggesting it is status and not money that we are really after

### My Future Relationships

I know that I don't want to meet my future partner online.

>Some ten years ago, I found myself in an after-dinner conversation, lubricated by wine, with an American who had been educated at an Ivy League college and was then teaching in Europe. As our conversation drifted toward matters of life, marriage and children, I was initially surprised by his statement that whoever he had married, the outcome in terms of where they lived, what type of house they owned, what kind of holidays and entertainment they would enjoy, and even what colleges their children would attend would be practically the same. His reasoning was as follows: “**When I went to [Ivy League institution], I knew that I would marry a woman I met there. Women also knew the same thing. We all knew that our pool of desirable marriage candidates would never be as vast again. And then whomever I married would be a specimen of the same genre: They were all well-educated, smart women who came from the same social class, read the same novels and newspapers, dressed the same, had the same preferences about restaurants, hiking, places to live, cars to drive and people to see, as well about how to take care of the kids and what schools they should attend. It really made almost no difference socially whom among them I married.**” Article by [[Branko Milanovic](https://quillette.com/2019/10/18/rich-like-me-how-assortative-mating-is-driving-income-inequality/)]

### The Immediate Future: Summer Term

I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what were doing.

There are some positive things that have happened to build one so far. I enjoy playing lacrosse and jitsu, improving both is important.

#### Jitsu

The role of president for jitsu is great. I want to be the best president for quite a few years.

> "Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly. Thiel

#### Lacrosse

There is lots of popular chit-chat about habits that are good for you (gym, etc.). However more fundamental is changing your personality.

During the first term of lacrosse, the captain (Ash) told us about how he started lacrosse at university. He described how about halfway through the term he went from it being a chore to go to training to being excited to go. I believe that he changed to include lacrosse as part of his personality.

This is when peer pressure can actually be positive. I have felt this multiple times so far. There have been multiple times where I don't really want to go to training but I end up going due to peer pressure I've put myself under. By telling friends and family that I was playing lacrosse, deciding no to go was a failure. And I didn't to be seen failing. Therefore I always ended up going.

I also always enjoyed the training sessions - and often could feel myself improving. However getting to the session was difficult. I want to begin going to S&C on Fridays and Sports Nights every Wednesday and get further into the sport.

At the end of the term I began doing wall-ball quite a bit. I also want to start skipping to improve footwork. Also strength.

### Changing Oneself

>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. **Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.** James Clear

>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

A very personal example would be playing the video game Destiny - which I did most days fter schools with my close friends whilst at PCMS. When I moved from PCMS to RGS I stopped playing video games almost entirely. It was no longer part of my from personality.

>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

>Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.

>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

identity repeats beings

# My first two terms at Imperial

*Easter 2022*

### Looking Back: School

Looking back at my school time, I was very privileged. I grew up in the nicest part of the North East and went to the best school in the North East.

I remember talking to my parents about how lucky I was. My dad disagreed. He said many of the things I viewed as lucky were due to my parents making intelligent decisions. Now I agree with him. I hope to be able to do the same with my children.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did very little work at school. I was able to waltz through most exams.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did lots of extra-curricular activities and I'm proud of that.

I'm glad of the time in school. I think it was reasonably well used.

### Winter Term

A good term.

One change is that I've stopped climbing. I've taken up new sports (jitsu and lacrosse). I'm not a massive fan of the people who do climbing. Agi and Waldo have also stopped climbing. It is no longer cool.

### Spring Term

This term was bad! There are two major failures this term: diet and sociability.

At the start of the term we sat the M&R exam. At the time I thought it went horrifically.

My diet this term has been poor. I have been eating mostly ultra-processed foods.

less social
