<h1>My first two terms at Imperial</h1>

<h4>Looking Back: School</h4>

Looking back at my school time, I was very privileged. I grew up in the nicest part of the North East and went to the best school in the North East.

I remember talking to my parents about how lucky I was. My dad disagreed. He said many of the things I viewed as lucky were due to my parents making intelligent decisions. Now I agree with him. I hope to be able to do the same with my children.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did very little work at school. I was able to waltz through most exams.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did lots of extra-curricular activities and I'm proud of that.

I'm glad of the time in school. I think it was reasonably well used.

<h4>Winter Term</h4>

A good term.

One change is that I've stopped climbing. I've taken up new sports (jitsu and lacrosse). I'm not a massive fan of the people who do climbing. Agi and Waldo have also stopped climbing. It is no longer cool.

<h4>Spring Term</h4>

This term was bad! There are two major failures this term: diet and sociability.

At the start of the term we sat the M&R exam. At the time I thought it went horrifically.

My diet this term has been poor. I have been eating mostly ultra-processed foods.

less social

<h4>The Future: Summer Term</h4>

I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what were doing.

Ultimately there are two major life goals: family and work. I want to avoid setting goals as every time I've tried this I've failed. Instead I want to focus on systems and build these into my identity.

There are some positive things that have happened to build one so far. I enjoy playing lacrosse and jitsu, improving both is important.

**Jitsu**

The role of president for jitsu is great. I want to be the best president for quite a few years.

**Lacrosse**

There is lots of popular chit-chat about habits that are good for you (gym, etc.). However more fundamental is changing your personality.

During the first term of lacrosse, the captain (Ash) told us about how he started lacrosse at university. He described how about halfway through the term he went from it being a chore to go to training to being excited to go. I believe that he changed to include lacrosse as part of his personality.

This is when peer pressure can actually be positive. I have felt this multiple times so far. There have been multiple times where I don't really want to go to training but I end up going due to peer pressure I've put myself under. By telling friends and family that I was playing lacrosse, deciding no to go was a failure. And I didn't to be seen failing. Therefore I always ended up going.

I also always enjoyed the training sessions - and often could feel myself improving. However getting to the session was difficult. I want to begin going to S&C on Fridays and Sports Nights every Wednesday and get further into the sport.

At the end of the term I began doing wall-ball quite a bit. I also want to start skipping to improve footwork. Also strength.
