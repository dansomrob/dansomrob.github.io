# Aims/Goals

*Easter 2022*

>The hardest thing is not doing what you want - it's knowing what you want. [@Naval](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1514833143294877700)

Over the very long term, there are two main parts to your life.

- Your job
- Your family

I want to avoid setting goals as every time I've tried this I've failed. Instead I want to focus on systems and build these into my identity.

### My Future Career

I like to tell people I am studying physics 'because it makes me sound smart'. I don't know what occupation I'd like to go into.

Looking at the [data](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/careers-service/public/resources/dlhe/ug-tables/Physics-tables.pdf) we find about 40-50% go into further study and 40-50% go into industry.

Of those in employment about 25% go into finance and about 25% go into tech.

I now know I don't want to go into finance. I would rather go into tech, especially atoms not bits.

### The Future: Summer Term

I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what were doing.

There are some positive things that have happened to build one so far. I enjoy playing lacrosse and jitsu, improving both is important.

#### Jitsu

The role of president for jitsu is great. I want to be the best president for quite a few years.

#### Lacrosse

There is lots of popular chit-chat about habits that are good for you (gym, etc.). However more fundamental is changing your personality.

During the first term of lacrosse, the captain (Ash) told us about how he started lacrosse at university. He described how about halfway through the term he went from it being a chore to go to training to being excited to go. I believe that he changed to include lacrosse as part of his personality.

This is when peer pressure can actually be positive. I have felt this multiple times so far. There have been multiple times where I don't really want to go to training but I end up going due to peer pressure I've put myself under. By telling friends and family that I was playing lacrosse, deciding no to go was a failure. And I didn't to be seen failing. Therefore I always ended up going.

I also always enjoyed the training sessions - and often could feel myself improving. However getting to the session was difficult. I want to begin going to S&C on Fridays and Sports Nights every Wednesday and get further into the sport.

At the end of the term I began doing wall-ball quite a bit. I also want to start skipping to improve footwork. Also strength.

>The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. **Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.** James Clear

>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

>True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

>Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.

>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.

*Easter 2022*

### Looking Back: School

Looking back at my school time, I was very privileged. I grew up in the nicest part of the North East and went to the best school in the North East.

I remember talking to my parents about how lucky I was. My dad disagreed. He said many of the things I viewed as lucky were due to my parents making intelligent decisions. Now I agree with him. I hope to be able to do the same with my children.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did very little work at school. I was able to waltz through most exams.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did lots of extra-curricular activities and I'm proud of that.

I'm glad of the time in school. I think it was reasonably well used.

### Winter Term

A good term.

One change is that I've stopped climbing. I've taken up new sports (jitsu and lacrosse). I'm not a massive fan of the people who do climbing. Agi and Waldo have also stopped climbing. It is no longer cool.

### Spring Term

This term was bad! There are two major failures this term: diet and sociability.

At the start of the term we sat the M&R exam. At the time I thought it went horrifically.

My diet this term has been poor. I have been eating mostly ultra-processed foods.
