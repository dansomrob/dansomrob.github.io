# Aims & Goals

*Summer 2022*

### Introduction

Over the very long term, there are two main parts to your life. **Your job** & **your family**. Your job is how you meaningfully contribute to society. Your family is what keeps the human population alive in future generations.

### My Anti-Goals

Some things I know I don't every want to happen to me are

* Get divorced
* Get fat

Lots of my family has put on the pounds, I would like to avoid this. I also want to avoid getting divorced, it has a major negative impact on children.

### My Future Career

I like to tell people I am studying physics 'because it makes me sound smart'. I don't know what occupation I'd like to go into. I know that I don't want to do PhD.

> *From time to time I meet with a youth in whom I can wish for no alteration or improvement, only I am sorry to see how often his nature makes him quite ready to swim with the stream of the time; and it is on this that I would always insist, that man in his fragile boat has the rudder placed in his hand, just that he may not be at the mercy of the waves, but follow the direction of his own insight.* Goethe

### My Future Relationships

I know that I don't want to meet my future partner online.

>Some ten years ago, I found myself in an after-dinner conversation, lubricated by wine, with an American who had been educated at an Ivy League college and was then teaching in Europe. As our conversation drifted toward matters of life, marriage and children, I was initially surprised by his statement that whoever he had married, the outcome in terms of where they lived, what type of house they owned, what kind of holidays and entertainment they would enjoy, and even what colleges their children would attend would be practically the same. His reasoning was as follows: “**When I went to [Ivy League institution], I knew that I would marry a woman I met there. Women also knew the same thing. We all knew that our pool of desirable marriage candidates would never be as vast again. And then whomever I married would be a specimen of the same genre: They were all well-educated, smart women who came from the same social class, read the same novels and newspapers, dressed the same, had the same preferences about restaurants, hiking, places to live, cars to drive and people to see, as well about how to take care of the kids and what schools they should attend. It really made almost no difference socially whom among them I married.**” Article by [Branko Milanovic](https://quillette.com/2019/10/18/rich-like-me-how-assortative-mating-is-driving-income-inequality/)

### Lemmings

> Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in **fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers** like management consulting and investment banking.

Of those [who have graduated](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/careers-service/public/resources/dlhe/ug-tables/Physics-tables.pdf) from Imperial Physics (my course), typically >25% go into finance, ~20% go into tech and ~10% go into consulting. All elite jobs. About 45% go into further study.

Although I am a major critic of lemming-like behaviour, I often behave go with the crowd with lack of thought. It affects everything from what I wear to what I want to do. Some examples

* A good friend of mine family owned a bread maker. The bread was fantastic. I decided I would like one. So I bought one - the cheapest one available. It was bad, the bread was horrific and I only used it once or twice. A complete waste of ~ £50.
* The same good friend of mine also owned a very nice coat. I decided I wanted one, it cost ~ £150. I never wear it. I am often embarrassed to wear it.

The truth is whenever I do something because a group decides it's valuable, I always end up regretting it. I have an internal desire to be different from others, and copying the group doesn't work.

### You Are Your Job

In Fight Club, Brad Pitt's character famously says

> You are not your job.

This is wrong. Your job is an integral part of you. It is how you meaningfully contribute to society. As Thiel contributes

> At college, model students obsessively hedge their futures by assembling a suite of exotic and minor skills. Every university believes in “excellence,” and hundred- page course catalogs arranged alphabetically according to arbitrary departments of knowledge seem designed to reassure you that “it doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do it well.” That is completely false. **It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future**.

### My? Goals



# My first year at Imperial

*Summer 2022*

### Pre-University: School

Looking back at my school time, I was very privileged. I grew up in the nicest part of the North East and went to the best school in the North East.

I remember talking to my parents about how lucky I was. My dad disagreed. He said many of the things I viewed as lucky were due to my parents making intelligent decisions. Now I agree with him. I hope to be able to do the same with my children.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did very little work at school. I was able to waltz through most exams.

I've also come to the conclusion that I did lots of extra-curricular activities and I'm proud of that.

I'm glad of the time in school. I think it was reasonably well used.

### Winter Term

A good term.

One change is that I've stopped climbing. I've taken up new sports (jitsu and lacrosse). I'm not a massive fan of the people who do climbing. Agi and Waldo have also stopped climbing. It is no longer cool.

### Spring Term

This term was bad! There are two major failures this term: diet and sociability.

At the start of the term we sat the M&R exam. At the time I thought it went horrifically.

My diet this term has been poor. I have been eating mostly ultra-processed foods.

hiding diet

less social

### Summer Term

This term my behaviour was far more me-like. I've found a good 'holding-pattern'. I've got a group of friends I like to spend time with an some extra-curricular activities (Jitsu, less lax this term).

I've drank a lot less. Unless there is significant social pressure (out with lacrosse team) I mostly don't drink when out with other people.
