title: The History of Acidity

## Chemistry in Antiquity

The term acid comes from Greece through Rome. Both ‘acid’ and ‘acetic’ come the Latin ‘acere’ meaning ‘sour-tasting’. Alkalis were less well understood, although it was well known they could be created by mixing ash with water. By mixing animal fat, ash and water the Greeks were able to produce soap. The word ‘alkali’ came from the Arabic word for ‘roasting’. The term ‘base’ came about later and its history is less clear.  

## The History of Litmus

I will not take a brief tangent from chemistry and talk about dyes, however you will see this to be important and interesting.

### Tyrian Purple

Tyrian Purple (also called Royal Purple) is a reddish-purple dye. It gets its name from the city of Tyre (modern day Lebanon). Production of the dye first began about 1200BC by the Phoenicians. Production continued until the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

The dye was highly valued as its colour would not fade over time, which most other dyes did and actually improved in colour with weathering.

Production of the dye involves a complex process which uses the mucus excreted from several species of Murex sea-snails, which lived in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.

The process required a significant number of snails to produce the dye. A 1908 experiment determined it would take 12,00 snails to produce 1.4g of dye (others found 8000 snails for 1g). The production costs were high, making the dye exceptionally valuable.

Examples of it's value can be found thought out western history. In fourth century Rome, sumptuary laws were tightened to such an extend only the emperor could wear purple. In the Byzantine empire, production was controlled by the royal courts.

Popular legend tells that the discovery of Trian Purple dye was by Hercules of Tyre (specifically his dog) whilst his dog was eating Murex snails on the beach. These stained his mouth purple. The is shown in the painting “The Discovery of Purple by Hercules’s Dog” by Theodoor van Thulden in 1636.

The recipe for Tyrian Purple dye was a closely guarded secret to ensure a monopoly of the trade and ensure high prices. Therefore, a detailed history is hard to account. Most of Tyre’s wealth came from the Tyrian Purple dye trade.

### Orchil Dyes

Due to the high expensive nature of Tyrian Purple dye, and the status associated with it, numerous alternative dyes were sought. Including many in antiquity.

Orchil (also known as orcein, archil or lacmus) dyes are the name for a number of dyes produced from lichen (also known as *orchella weeds*). Lichen are organisms where both fungi and algae live symbiotically.

Difference methods of prearing the dye would result in different shades of colour.

Litmus comes from of the Old Norse word for ‘dye’ or ‘colour’.  

## Chemistry in the Enlightenment

Lavoisier, in 1776, proposed that all acids contained the substance oxygen. Both nitric acid (aqua fortis) and sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) - HNO<sub>3</sub> & H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> - contain oxygen; although HCl (muriatic acid) does not. Davy, during his study of gases, tested this theory and found it to be wrong.

Two years earlier , in 1774, Priestley successfully isolated oxygen, then called dephlogisticated air. As Lavoisier believed that the phlogiston theory was incorrect, which Priestley disagreed with, he gave the substance a new name. Lavoisier coined the term ‘oxygen’. The names comes from the Ancient Greek roots, ‘oxys’ / 'ὀξύς' meaning sharp (acidic) and ‘genes’ / ‘γενής’ meaning something that produces. Hence oxygen literally means something that produces sharpness (acid). Despite the scientific disagreement, the name stayed.

Liebig proposed that it was hydrogen that was responsible for the acidity of certain substances. Although this theory also had issues, for example NH<sub>3</sub> is basic but contains hydrogen and thus should be acidic.

Arrhenius proposes that it wasn’t hydrogen that caused acid behaviour but hydrogen ions – H<sup>+</sup> whereas bases were from the OH<sup>-</sup> ion. Independently Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry, in 1923, generalised this theory such that acids were H+ donors whilst bases were H+ acceptors.
