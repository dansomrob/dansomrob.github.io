title: In Defence of SAGE

Recent 'right-wing' (loosely used) critics of lockdown have been highly critical of SAGE and Covid models in general. I don't propose to explore the details of the models and predictions, or the data. Instead I want to explore the philosophy of the comparisons. This article is a light hearted rebuttal against the critics.

[This](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/how-did-sage-scenarios-compare-to-reality-an-update){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} Spectator article compares models  of the Jan/Feb covid peak and the actual NHS data.

In science, a vital idea - even the fundamental purpose of science - is to be able to rationally explain phenomenon. This is often done in an order: first A, then B, then C, and so forth. It often depends on some axioms from which we can build our theories.

In mathematics this is done using proofs. Statements not proved are 'merely' conjectures. A mathematician's job is to logically prove a statement given some axioms. It is not enough to just show expected behaviour holds for lots of cases (eg. the Goldbach conjecture, which has been shown up to 4e18), a proof must be shown.

The PÃ³lya conjecture is a common example of the importance of proofs. Although true for many values, Brian Haselgrove showed there was a counterexample at about 1.845e361, a ridiculously large number.

In physics, we make comparisons to real world data - this allows us to evaluate our theories.

Stephen Duneier's' book *AlphaBrian* is brilliant. This passage is from chapter three.

>A decision is considered rational when the decision maker does what is most reasonable given all the relevant information at the time the decision is made. Rational decisions are what we aspire to achieve. They are optimal. On the other hand, a decision is considered right if the outcomes is at least as good as all other possible outcomes. In other words, it  is considered right, because the actual outcome was successful. Importantly rational decisions are not necessarily the same as right decisions, and the decision that winds up being right may not have been rational. The key difference between the two is that a decision can be deemed rational versus irrational at the moment it is made, whereas the assessment about whether it was right or wrong can only be made with the benefit of hindsight.

Although not Shakespeare, Duneier makes some important points worth examining:

- **most reasonable** - Some level of opinion might be required, it may be a political decision.
- **at the time the decision is made** - information might be limited when making the decision, or the information may be incorrect. This can allow a rational decision to be wrong.
- **They are optimal** - Over the long-term a rational decision is what we aim to achieve, it's controllable. Being right is uncontrollable. Over time, rational decisions are more likely to be right.
- **the outcomes is at least as good as all other possible outcomes** - the outcome might not be positive, it might be the least worst outcome
- **rational decisions are not necessarily the same as right decisions** - the most important idea of this passage
- **with the benefit of hindsight** - it's only after the event we can determine our results, some level of reflection of the event is required - this facilitates learning.

There is an important point to raise, we aren't judged on whether are decisions are rational, but whether they were correct. A hedge fund succeeds if its trades make money, not if the trading decisios were made rationally.

Over the long term the more rationally we make our decision, the more likely we'll be right over the long term.

In the book, Duneier also raises the important idea of the amount of time we have 'skin-in-the-game'.

Sports games

We control our inputs, not the outputs. We can control how much we revise for a test, but not how successful that exam goes. However, more revision increases our chance of doing well in the exam.

A side note on **regression to the mean**.

This brings is back to the critics of SAGE's models.

When criticising SAGE we can ask operational questions, such as *given data from country x was realesed on this date, why wasn't it incorporated into the models until this other date?*" We could also ask epidemiological questions on the models (i.e. questioning the rationality not the rightness). But we should avoid critism for their correctness.

This isn't to say being wrong is okay, the aim is to be correct.

Would you want Boris to say 'We'll, we saw a tweet saying covid wasn't as severe in other countries so no actions needed...' No, we'd want JVT to explain  so were not doing x - no we want them to be rational

For sake of argument, consider the inverse. A randomly made up data set but with matches the data well. Over the long term the likeliness of this model decreases, but it way work well short-term. By the critics own marking criterion this is a good model. It matches the data! But in truth it's a crap model. It's useless. It's gambling.

The crypto hamster [Mr. Goxx](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58707641){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} was an experiment by two 30-something Germans which allowed a hamster to trade crypto by standing on two pressure plates.

Even though Goxx Capital achieved returns of +19.41%, we don't see J.P. Morgan opening new 'hamster funds'. Because even billionaires want their money handled in a rational manner. Otherwise it's just gambling. Sometimes, hedge funds are not *right* (eg, LTCM), sometimes they are. But they are paid to be rational decision makers about the stock market.

SAGE may or may not have been rational - I'm not a good enough epidemiologist to know. SAGE's models were not correct. But why does that matter? Rationality matters. Whether it's the government's response, or SAGE's models, rational decision making should be our measure. Being right is just an outcome.
