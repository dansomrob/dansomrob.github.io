title: In Defence of SAGE
---
Recent 'right-wing' (loosely used) critics of lockdown have been highly critical of SAGE and Covid models in general. I don't propose to explore the details of the models and predictions, or the data. Instead I want to explore the philosophy of the comparisons. This article is a light hearted rebuttal against the critics.

In science, a vital idea - even the fundamental purpose of science - is to be able to rationally explain phenomenon. This is often done in an order: fist A, then B, then C, and so forth. It often depends on some axioms from which we can build our theories.

In mathematics this is done using proofs. Statements not proved are 'merely' conjectures. A mathematician's job is to logically prove a statement given some axioms. It is not enough to just show expected behaviour holds for lots of cases (eg. the Goldbach conjecture, which has been shown up to 4e18), a proof must be shown.

The PÃ³lya conjecture is a common example of the importance of proofs. Although true for many values, Brian Haselgrove showed there was a counterexample at about 1.845e361, a ridiculously large number.

In physics, we make comparisons to real world data - this allows us to evaluate our theories, often heavily dependant on statistics.

Stephen Duneier is one of my favourite authors. His book *AlphaBrian* is exceptional. This passage is from chapter three.

>A decision is considered rational when the decision maker does what is most reasonable given all the relevant information at the time the decision is made. Rational decisions are what we aspire to achieve. They are optimal. On the other hand, a decision is considered right if the outcomes is at least as good as all other possible outcomes. In other words, it  is considered right, because the actual outcome was successful. Importantly rational decisions are not necessarily the same as right decisions, and the decision that winds up being right may not have been rational. The key difference between the two is that a decision can be deemed rational versus irrational at the moment it is made, whereas the assessment about whether it was right or wrong can only be made with the benefit of hindsight.

Although not Shakespeare, Duneier makes some important points worth examining:

- **most reasonable** - Some level of opinion might be required, it may be a political decision.
- **at the time the decision is made** -
- **They are optimal** -
- **the outcomes is at least as good as all other possible outcomes** - the outcome might not be positive, it might be the least worst outcome
- **rational decisions are not necessarily the same as right decisions** - the most important idea
- **with the benefit of hindsight** -

There is an important point to raise, we aren't judged on whether are decisions are rational, but whether they were correct. A hedge fund succeeds if its trades make money, not if they were made rationally. However over the long term the more rationally we make our decision, the more likely we'll be right over the long term.

Sports games

We control our inputs, not the outputs. We can control how much we revise for a test, but not how successful that exam goes.

When criticising SAGE we can ask operational questions, such as ""*given data from country x was realesed on this date, why wasn't it incorpereted into the models until this other date?*"" was information from other countries used in the models at the correct time. ect

would you want boris to say '...' so were not doing x - no we want them to be rational

Let's consider the inverse, a randomly made up data set but with matches the data well. The entire points of statistics is to

The crypto hamster [Mr. Goxx](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58707641){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} was an experiment by two 30-something Germans which allowed a hamster to trade crypto by standing on two pressure plates.

Even though Goxx Capital achieved returns of +19.41%, we don't see J.P. Morgan opening new 'hamster funds'. Because even billionaires want their money handled in a rational manner. Otherwise it's just gambling. Sometimes, hedge funds are not *right* (eg, LTCM), sometimes they are. But they are paid to be rational decision makers about the stock market.

SAGE may or may not have been rational - I'm not a good enough epidemiologist to know. SAGE's models were not correct. But why does that matter? Rationality matters. Whether it's the government's response, or SAGE's models, rational decision making should be our measure. Being right is just an outcome.
