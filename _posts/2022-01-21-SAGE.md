title: In Defence of SAGE

Recent 'right-wing' (loosely used) critics of lockdown have been highly critical of SAGE and Covid models in general. I don't propose to explore the details of the models and predictions, or the data. Instead I want to explore the philosophy of the comparisons. This article is a light hearted rebuttal against the critics.

[This](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/how-did-sage-scenarios-compare-to-reality-an-update){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} Spectator article compares models  of the Jan/Feb covid peak and the actual NHS data.

In science, a vital idea - even the fundamental purpose of science - is to be able to rationally explain phenomenon. This is often done in an order: fist A, then B, then C, and so forth. It often depends on some axioms from which we can build our theories.

In mathematics this is done using proofs. Statements not proved are 'merely' conjectures. A mathematician's job is to logically prove a statement given some axioms.

>A decision is considered rational when the decision maker does what is most reasonable given all the relevant information at the time the decision is made. Rational decisions are what we aspire to achieve. They are optimal. On the other hand, a decision is considered right if the outcomes is at least as good as all other possible outcomes. In other words, it  is considered right, because the actual outcome was successful. Importantly rational decisions are not necessarily the same as right decisions, and the decision that winds up being right may not have been rational. The key difference between the two is that a decision can be deemed rational versus irrational at the moment it is made, whereas the assessment about whether it was right or wrong can only be made with the benefit of hindsight.

Although not Shakespeare, Duneier makes some important points:

- **most reasonable** - Some level of opinion might be required, it may be a political decision.
- **at the time the decision is made** -
- **They are optimal** -
- **the outcomes is at least as good as all other possible outcomes** -
- **rational decisions are not necessarily the same as right decisions** -
- **with the benefit of hindsight** - 

we can ask opertaional questions, was infomation from other countries used in the models at the correct time. ect

Let's consider the inverse, a randomly made up data set but with matches the data well. The entire points of statistics is to
