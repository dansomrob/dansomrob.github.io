title: The Distribution of Elites
---
In every society a small number of people tend to have a large impact. There are often power laws at play.

It is often hard to predict exactly which people will have an impact and it would be wrong to assume they operate in a vacuum, thy will have people who support them and work with them.

However, we can often find similar personality traits in these people. Interviews are often used to screen for these people, elite universities try to get them as students.

This are some thoughts on government and elites.

**Elite Universities**
There has been much recent controversy about the Harvard selection process. Mainly that the primary selector is not intelligence.

Elite universities are such because the children of the elites go there. Entrance requirements to stop anyone getting in and allows children of the non-elite entry too.

The Imperial Examinations were important exams used in Imperial China from the Han dynasty (~200BC) to the Qing dynasty (1900 AD).

Chinese dynasties were formed by military conquest. The leaders would require a number of intelligent and well-educated officials to carry out the bureaucratic functions and guide the ruler. These positions were given to people based on their performance in the Keyu. Any adult male could take the exam, however due to the costs of taking time to study, mainly the wealthy would apply.

Only ~5% of entrants passed the exam. The who failed didn't lose wealth of social status. Unitary function of the exam.

Abolished by the Qing dynasty as passing the exam was not related to being able to govern well.
