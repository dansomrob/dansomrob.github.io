### The Rocket Equation
The (ideal) rocket equation is named after the Russian mathematician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903 who independently derived it in 1903. However the British mathematician William Moore derived it in 1810.

$$\Delta v = v_e\ln{\frac{m_i}{m_f}}$$

It gives us an expression for &\Delta v$. Every orbital manoeuvre has a specific value. For example to get from earth to LEO takes $9.7kms^{-1}$ of $\Delta v$. 

(This)[http://sdg.aero.upm.es/index.php/online-apps/porkchop-plot] online tool by the Polytechnic University of Madrid can be used to create porkchop plots for specific dates and orbits.
