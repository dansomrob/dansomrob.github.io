I would like to be happy in life. Here is some scientific findings looking at life satisfaction.

#### Friendships

[This](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-08052-003) paper by Demir & Weitekamp found that

> Friendship variables accounted for 58% of the variance in happiness. Results revealed that friendship quality predicted happiness above and beyond the influence of personality and number of friends.

Friends are important.

#### Extraversion

Zelenski, Sobocko & Whelan's [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263047178_Introversion_Solitude_and_Subjective_Well-Being) found that

> introverts enjoy social interactions about as much as extraverts ... extraverts report more positive affect than introverts even when alone ... introverts may be less prone to notice or seek out pleasant situations, and less likely to maintain positive feelings

It has [been shown](https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1488214540139606025) that when instructed to behave in an extraverted manor, both introverts and extraverts felt better than when instructed to behave in an introverted manor. The trait of extraversion is related to positive emotions.

#### Education
[This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487017302210) paper by Ingebjørg Kristoffersen shows that that there is no correlation between education and happiness

> this suggests **people with higher levels of education tend to have higher expectations of life circumstances**, but **do not systematically differ in their ability to meet their expectations**. Consequently, the **overall association between education and life satisfaction is neutral**.

#### Extra-curricular

[This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272200266X) paper by Jetten et al. looks at sporting extra curricular activities and depression/anxiety amongst adolescent boys. It measured these at T1 (time 1) and then a year later at T2 (time 2).

>For instance, while **physical fitness correlated with depression and anxiety** at both timepoints, **physical fitness nevertheless did not predict change over time in depression and anxiety**. This finding is important when considering interventions to improve mental health, as it suggests that **getting adolescents to engage in physical activity in schools to improve their physical fitness may not always produce positive change in depression and anxiety**.

>The number of sports groups that participants were involved in at T1 was unrelated to anxiety at T1 and T2 and unrelated to depression at T1 and T2.

>Second, our results suggest that mere participation in a greater number of extra-curricular (sport or non-sport) groups at T1 was not associated with mental health benefits. That is, even though taking part in more extra-curricular sport groups at T1 was associated with lower depression, it was not associated with lower anxiety at T1, and **nor did mere participation in more extra-curricular groups predict reduced depression and anxiety over time**. Accordingly, we did not find that a ‘more the merrier’ effect flowed from the number of extra-curricular sporting groups that adolescents engaged in.

>the more that participants indicated that they **belonged** to multiple groups, the lower their anxiety and depression at T1 and T2. Importantly too, these correlations between multiple group membership and anxiety and depression at T2 remained significant when controlling for T1 anxiety and T1 depression. This suggests that **belonging to multiple groups (sports or non-sports) predicted change in anxiety and depression over time**.

>The best predictor of participants' mental health over time was the extent to which they **identified with multiple social groups** — including, but not limited to, sports groups — and the extent to which these social groups were compatible with other social groups that were important to them. Even though the strength of relationships was modest, these data suggest that **improvements in mental health effects over time arise less from people being physically active than from being socially active**.

#### Work

[Daniel Kahneman's]() answer to the 2011 Edge question looks at the effect of income on life satisfaction

> Income is an important determinant of people's satisfaction with their lives, but it is far less important than most people think. If everyone had the same income, the differences among people in life satisfaction would be reduced by less than 5%.

However, education might effect income. Kahneman's response was

> Education is an important determinant of income — one of the most important — but it is less important than most people think. If everyone had the same education, the inequality of income would be reduced by less than 10%.

Therefore income isn't very important for life satisfaction.

#### Marriage
