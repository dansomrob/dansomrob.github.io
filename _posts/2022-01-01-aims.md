**2021 - A Year in Review**

I'll briefly list things that've happened in 2021.
- Achieved top grades in all subjects at secondary school.
- Began UG studies at Imperial.
- Started playing lacrosse and learning jitsu.
- Went to the gym for first time.
- Did some swimming (over 1km! - this is good for me).
- Worked on Ivy House with Agi.
