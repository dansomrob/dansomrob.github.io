title: The Teleology of Education
---
I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **telos = purpose** of what we're doing.

Many have suggested various aims of universities.

* A major attracting quality of college is the improvement to you job prospects.
* Going to elite universities acts as a signal.
* tournament

This is a very opened ended question and also very difficult to answer. In some ways this is a positive things. As everyone is different, education is something everyone will participate in differently. Ultimately this is a personal, not a societal question.

## Asian-American Culture
Paper Tigers by Wesley Yang [[2](https://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/)] is a fantastic article. When analysing western culture, it's very useful to get opinions from those raised in different cultures.

Yang has the following feelings on the culture of Asian-American immigrants.

>Let me summarize my feelings toward Asian values: Fuck filial piety. Fuck grade-grubbing. Fuck Ivy League mania. Fuck deference to authority. Fuck humility and hard work. Fuck harmonious relations. Fuck sacrificing for the future. Fuck earnest, striving middle-class servility.

Yang interview a fellow Asian-American Jefferson Mao, who described himself as:

>“I got good grades and I love literature and I want to be a writer and an intellectual; at the same time, I’m the first person in my family to go to college, my parents don’t speak English very well, and we don’t own the apartment in Flushing that we live in. I mean, I’m proud of my parents and my neighborhood and what I perceive to be my artistic potential or whatever, but sometimes I feel like I’m jumping the gun a generation or two too early.”

Mao attended Stuyvesant High School, where he noticed:

>Mao began to study the racially inflected social hierarchies at Stuyvesant, where, in a survey undertaken by the student newspaper this year, slightly more than half of the respondents reported that their friends came from within their own ethnic group. His attention focused on the mostly white (and Manhattan-dwelling) group whose members seemed able to manage the crushing workload while still remaining socially active. **“The general gist of most high-school movies is that the pretty cheerleader gets with the big dumb jock, and the nerd is left to bide his time in loneliness. But at some point in the future,” he says, “the nerd is going to rule the world, and the dumb jock is going to work in a carwash.**

>**“At Stuy, it’s completely different: If you looked at the pinnacle, the girls and the guys are not only good-looking and socially affable, they also get the best grades and star in the school plays and win election to student government. It all converges at the top. It’s like training for high society.** It was jarring for us Chinese kids. You got the sense that you had to study hard, but it wasn’t enough.”

>Mao was becoming clued in to the fact that **there was another hierarchy behind the official one that explained why others were getting what he never had — “a high-school sweetheart” figured prominently on this list — and that this mysterious hierarchy was going to determine what happened to him in life.** “You realize there are things you really don’t understand about courtship or just acting in a certain way. Things that somehow come naturally to people who go to school in the suburbs and have parents who are culturally assimilated.” I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had “sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble.” This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: **Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge “about social norms and propriety” had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.**

Later in the article Yang compares Eastern and western proverbs.

>“The loudest duck gets shot” is a Chinese proverb. “The nail that sticks out gets hammered down” is a Japanese one. Its Western correlative: “**The squeaky wheel gets the grease.**"

In the west, standing out is a great thing. It is rewarded.

This brings us onto the universities which have the largest impact on society, the elite universities.

## Elites

There has been much recent controversy about the Harvard selection process. Mainly that the primary selector is not intelligence.

Elite universities are such because the children of the elites go there. Entrance requirements to stop anyone getting in and allows children of the non-elite entry too.

Klemen Miklavic's [essay](https://www.academia.edu/31401214/Elite_vs_Mass_Higher_Education_A_Reflection_On_the_Purpose_of_Higher_Education) explores the difference between 'elite education' and 'mass education'.

> the typical Western university education of the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries was reserved to a small share of society. Higher education represented the venue where intellectual elites nurtured their manners and social networks, but also where typically elitist state professionals were trained.

> The more the universities were accessible, the less they were able to reproduce the established elite and thereby undermined the stability of the prevailing social hierarchy. Gradually, higher education ceased to be an institution for/of elites.

> The knowledge that an institution gives to the student is only second to the prestige of the label on the diploma.

### Extra-curriculars

Pedigree by Lauren Rivera [[1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0175F6HQ8)] talks about how 'elite students' get 'elite jobs'.

>... students from less privileged families are more likely to believe that extracurricular activities are irrelevant to their job prospects because what employers really care about are grades, tangible skills, and prior employment experiences and invest their time accordingly.

I've noticed this to be true at Imperial. Those who we're privately educated were more likely to participate in extra-curricular activities.

>Ironically, working-class students’ focus on academics (rather than social and extracurricular activities) while in school constrains, not expands, the types of jobs and incomes available to them when they graduate.

In the [FT review](https://www.ft.com/content/39628abc-ff2d-11e4-84b2-00144feabdc0) of the book, the review states

>In theory, this “pedigree” is meant to reflect individual merit and talent; in practice, though, it is hard for students to engage in extracurricular activity unless they come from an elite background to start with. Of course, some non-elite students manage to do this. But **a private high school, full of privileged kids, tends to provide a more supportive background than a public institution, even a highly competitive school**.

>“**Working-class students are more likely to enter college with the notion that the purpose of higher education is learning in the classrooms**, and invest their time and energy accordingly,” Rivera observes. “But the [fact that] these **students focus on academic rather than extra-curriculum pursuits adversely affects their job prospects**,” she adds, describing how time and again the people interviewing candidates for jobs made decisions based on subjective issues such as whether a candidate had “polish”, “breadth” — and “pedigree”.

### Nietzsche's Views
Nietzsche did a series of five lectures of education. Called *On the Future of Educational Institutions*, it took the form of an overheard conversation between a  philosophy professor and one of his students.

>Up until now, we have always believed that **the purpose of the gymnasium was to prepare students for the university**. This preparation was meant to make us independent enough to enjoy the extraordinary freedom of a university student - for no one in any sphere of life today is given as much freedom of choice and action as a student

I agree with Nietzsche's statement that students have a greater amount of freedom than anyone else. Currently, students are given lots of non-academic freedom - most are living away from family in halls.

Nietzsche asks *How are your students connected to the university system?* In a soliloquy, he responds that students learn by attending lectures, listening and writing. This actually means the students have very little academic freedom. The students are *attached to the university by a kind of umbilical cord*.

Nietzsche proclaims how <i>**it** [the university] makes demands, **it** legislates, **it** passes judgment</i>. The university becomes the higher authority, the arbitrator.

In this sense there is less academic freedom, even today I believe this will be true. However I do believe that Nietzsche overstates the importance of the university. As Nietzsche himself states

<i>Oh happy age, when the young and wise are educated enough to teach **themselves** how to walk!</i>

The very best will self teach. We live in a world where self teaching in entirely possible and practical. For most of history, scientists did not depend on a university. Many where wealthy and self funded. The most valuable asset of modern universities is the freedom they give to students to spend their time as they wish.

I feel Nietzsche's lectures were more political than philosophical and didn't really explore the purpose of education or provide some ideas for what education should become.

## Keju

The Imperial Examinations were important exams used in Imperial China from the Song dynasty (~1000AD) to the Qing dynasty (~1900 AD).

Chinese dynasties were formed by military conquest. The leaders would require a number of intelligent and well-educated officials to carry out the bureaucratic functions and guide the ruler. These positions were given to people based on their performance in the Keyu. Any adult male could take the exam, however due to the costs of taking time to study, mainly the wealthy would apply.

The exam was introduced to centralise power amongst the emperor and away from the aristocracy.

>Most important, the promise of the examinations transformed learning from an elite concern to a preoccupation. Education became less the domain of scholarly families comprising one portion of elite society and more an activity urged upon academically promising boys and young men throughout elite society. John W. Chaffee

>the true characteristic of the Song political system was not autocracy but "scholar-official government," made possible by the existence of the examination system as a means of validating political authority. Over the long run, the emperor shifted from being a figure with administrative power to one with symbolic power, tightly constrained by the system he was part of, even if he did not always act according to the ideals his ministers urged upon him; the emperor was not the top of a pyramid but the keystone in an arch, whose successful functioning depended on his staying in his place. Peter K. Bol

>Boys entered [private primary] school at eight and [government prefectural] college at fifteen. Those whose talents could be developed were selected and gathered in the college, whereas the inferior ones were returned to the farm, for scholars and farmers did not exchange occupations. Having entered college, one would not work on the farm. Thus scholars and farmers were completely differentiated. As to support in college, there was no worry about sons of officials. But even sons of commoners, as soon as they entered college, were sure to be supported [by the state]. Cheng Yi (1033–1107)

Only ~5% of entrants passed the exam.

Abolished by the Qing dynasty as passing the exam was not related to being able to govern well.

## Greater Income

One of the most popular reasons to do a degree currently is to improve employability.

In Tyler & Cowen's book [Talent](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1250275814/), they look at income inequality and educational level, finding that

> If you look at the years 1980-2000, the main driver of rising income differences - which explains 75% of the variation - is whether the person has a college degree, no degree or a graduate degree. But for 2000-2017, when we look at the rise in income inequality, amount of education only explains 38% of the variation.

> In the latter period, most of the income inequality is seen in people *within* the same educational group. In other words, **simply being educated only gets you so far; the real returns are to your talent above and beyond your educational level**.

## The Education of Unicorn Founders

The often told story is that education is useless and many 'great' entrepreneurs dropped out. This is not true. It is far more common for founders of unicorns (>$1bn val.) to be highly educated at prestigious universities.

![Founders]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/founders.jpg)
This is image is taken from Prof Ilya Strebulaev LinkedIn [[1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ilyavcandpe_unicorns-venturecapital-startups-activity-6874740268470554624-IEhP)].

We often focus on the outliers, eg Gates and Zuck, who have dropped out. Although very wealthy there are exceptions, not the rule. Their companies don't hire dropouts. It would be far better to complete college than drop out.

## Debt

I don't believe the student debt problem is that serious, especially in the UK.

## Marriage

 [Branko Milanovic's](https://quillette.com/2019/10/18/rich-like-me-how-assortative-mating-is-driving-income-inequality/) article on modern dating and it's effect on income equality contains an amazing paragraph.

> Some ten years ago, I found myself in an after-dinner conversation, lubricated by wine, with an American who had been educated at an Ivy League college and was then teaching in Europe. As our conversation drifted toward matters of life, marriage and children, I was initially surprised by his statement that whoever he had married, the outcome in terms of where they lived, what type of house they owned, what kind of holidays and entertainment they would enjoy, and even what colleges their children would attend would be practically the same. His reasoning was as follows: “**When I went to [Ivy League institution], I knew that I would marry a woman I met there. Women also knew the same thing. We all knew that our pool of desirable marriage candidates would never be as vast again. And then whomever I married would be a specimen of the same genre: They were all well-educated, smart women who came from the same social class, read the same novels and newspapers, dressed the same, had the same preferences about restaurants, hiking, places to live, cars to drive and people to see, as well about how to take care of the kids and what schools they should attend. It really made almost no difference socially whom among them I married.**”

Bryan Caplan's book [The Case Against Education](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0691196451/) gives a rather nihilistic explanation for expensive private schools.

> "the marriage market is probably the strongest reason to pay for expensive private schools. Going to Harvard may not get you a better job but almost certainly puts you in an exclusive dating pool for life"

## Lack of Creativity

One common critique of universities is they 'beat' the creativity out of students. At the end of their degree many go into more 'boring' occupations: finance, big tech, consulting. Although I believe we need more creative things going on I think there are some reasons as to why this isn't happening.

Although not my main argument, it's important to note that these 'boring' occupations are also high status. Many will go for this reason.

Now for my main argument. Elite universities are very selective. Part of their value from the degrees is because of the high rejection rate. However I think it will be an issue if universities are too selective. This is because the best students will find themselves competing with other equally good students. This builds on the idea of that too much competition can give you tunnel vision and make you ignore more creative ideas.

## Appendix A: The Purpose of College for Me

This may be the most difficult part of this exploratory 'essay'. A large part of modern-day university is signalling. I like to tell people I am studying physics 'because it makes me sound smart'. This is *blatant* [signalling]({{ site.url}}/books/chimp-polit).

The highest purpose of university is learning for learning's sake. I do enjoy physics, and would like to learn more about physics. I would like to supplement my degree with further knowledge in certain areas. I would like to self study in [geometric algebra]({{ site.url }}/notes/Geometric_Algebra/index) and also in [abstract algebra]({{ site.url }}/notes/Abstract_Algebra/index). This is because I feel these are importance areas of mathematics that are not part of the degree.

I don't yet know what I would like to do. I know there are some things I do not what to do. I do not want to go work in finance. I also don't want to do a PhD. I would like to work in technology - but not computer technology, maybe [aerospace]({% post_url 2022-01-221-space %})?

## Appendix B: The Future of College

[Pratyush Buddiga's](https://pratyushbuddiga.substack.com/p/churchs-theory-of-social-class-in?s=r) substack article looks at social class in education.

> For the majority of American parents, **college is the stamp of validation for their parenting**. They can and will remain deeply uncomfortable with any non-traditional choice that will intuitively feel like they’re providing an inferior alternative for their child.

> What I see instead is that the future of power is going to shift. **College is already starting to lose some of its prestige and signaling capability, particularly amongst the technological elite**.

> In two decades, every American child will have the “human right” to go to college, subsidized by the taxpayer, **just as everyone starts to wake up to the fact that many of those with the most power and wealth do not go to college anymore**.

## Appendix C: China vs America

The largest difference between the US and China is where the intellectual elites go (ignoring migration). In America they go to Silicon Valley or New York. In China some must go into city governance, via the process of the Gaokao.

### Silicon Valley

In the States, the intellectual elites go into tech/finance. However this means that the people who go into running the country are often pretty crappy.

Multi-million dollar movies get made about these sectors of employment. From finance films such as *Margin Call*, *Wolf of Wall Street*, *The Big Short* or films about tech: *The Social Network* or *Steve Jobs* to name a few.

### Gaokao

In modern day China to rise the ranks of the CCP depends on successfully running a smaller region before being promoted to running a larger region. This should allow only the more competent politicians to run the country. However in the UK/US & other western democracies senior politicians are decided based upon public opinion. This is not a praise of the CCP (whom I detest).
