title: The Teleology of Education
---
I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what we're doing.

This is a very opened ended question and also very difficult to answer. In some ways this is a positive things. As everyone is different, education is something everyone will participate in differently.

<h4>Educational Experience of Founders</h4>

The often told story is that education is useless and many 'great' entrepreneurs dropped out. This is not true. It is far more common for founders of unicorns (>$1bn val.) to be highly educated at prestigious universities.

The Thiel fellowship gave students $200,000 to drop out of college and start heir own business. By and large it was a failure.

#### Extra-curricular

Pedigree by Lauren Rivera [[1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0175F6HQ8)] talks about how 'elite students' get 'elite jobs'.

>... students from less privileged families are more likely to believe that extracurricular activities are irrelevant to their job prospects because what employers really care about are grades, tangible skills, and prior employment experiences and invest their time accordingly.

I've noticed this to be true at Imperial. Those who we're privately educated were more likely to participate in extra-curricular activities.

>Ironically, working-class students’ focus on academics (rather than social and extracurricular activities) while in school constrains, not expands, the types of jobs and incomes available to them when they graduate.

[This]() paper by ... looks at sporting extra curricular activities and depression/anxiety amongst adolescent boys. It measured these at T1 (time 1) and then a year later at T2 (time 2).

>For instance, while **physical fitness correlated with depression and anxiety** at both timepoints, **physical fitness nevertheless did not predict change over time in depression and anxiety**. This finding is important when considering interventions to improve mental health, as it suggests that **getting adolescents to engage in physical activity in schools to improve their physical fitness may not always produce positive change in depression and anxiety**.

>The number of sports groups that participants were involved in at T1 was unrelated to anxiety at T1 and T2 and unrelated to depression at T1 and T2.

>Second, our results suggest that mere participation in a greater number of extra-curricular (sport or non-sport) groups at T1 was not associated with mental health benefits. That is, even though taking part in more extra-curricular sport groups at T1 was associated with lower depression, it was not associated with lower anxiety at T1, and **nor did mere participation in more extra-curricular groups predict reduced depression and anxiety over time**. Accordingly, we did not find that a ‘more the merrier’ effect flowed from the number of extra-curricular sporting groups that adolescents engaged in.

>the more that participants indicated that they **belonged** to multiple groups, the lower their anxiety and depression at T1 and T2. Importantly too, these correlations between multiple group membership and anxiety and depression at T2 remained significant when controlling for T1 anxiety and T1 depression. This suggests that **belonging to multiple groups (sports or non-sports) predicted change in anxiety and depression over time**.

>The best predictor of participants' mental health over time was the extent to which they **identified with multiple social groups** — including, but not limited to, sports groups — and the extent to which these social groups were compatible with other social groups that were important to them. Even though the strength of relationships was modest, these data suggest that **improvements in mental health effects over time arise less from people being physically active than from being socially active**.

#### Asian-American Culture
Paper Tigers by Wesley Yang [[2](https://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/)] is a fantastic article. When analysing western culture, it's very useful to get opinions from those raised in different cultures.

Yang has the following feelings on the culture of Asian-American immigrants.

>Let me summarize my feelings toward Asian values: Fuck filial piety. Fuck grade-grubbing. Fuck Ivy League mania. Fuck deference to authority. Fuck humility and hard work. Fuck harmonious relations. Fuck sacrificing for the future. Fuck earnest, striving middle-class servility.

Yang interview a fellow Asian-American Jefferson Mao, who described himself as:

>“I got good grades and I love literature and I want to be a writer and an intellectual; at the same time, I’m the first person in my family to go to college, my parents don’t speak English very well, and we don’t own the apartment in Flushing that we live in. I mean, I’m proud of my parents and my neighborhood and what I perceive to be my artistic potential or whatever, but sometimes I feel like I’m jumping the gun a generation or two too early.”

Mao attended Stuyvesant High School, where he noticed:

>Mao began to study the racially inflected social hierarchies at Stuyvesant, where, in a survey undertaken by the student newspaper this year, slightly more than half of the respondents reported that their friends came from within their own ethnic group. His attention focused on the mostly white (and Manhattan-dwelling) group whose members seemed able to manage the crushing workload while still remaining socially active. **“The general gist of most high-school movies is that the pretty cheerleader gets with the big dumb jock, and the nerd is left to bide his time in loneliness. But at some point in the future,” he says, “the nerd is going to rule the world, and the dumb jock is going to work in a carwash.**

>**“At Stuy, it’s completely different: If you looked at the pinnacle, the girls and the guys are not only good-looking and socially affable, they also get the best grades and star in the school plays and win election to student government. It all converges at the top. It’s like training for high society.** It was jarring for us Chinese kids. You got the sense that you had to study hard, but it wasn’t enough.”

>Mao was becoming clued in to the fact that **there was another hierarchy behind the official one that explained why others were getting what he never had — “a high-school sweetheart” figured prominently on this list — and that this mysterious hierarchy was going to determine what happened to him in life.** “You realize there are things you really don’t understand about courtship or just acting in a certain way. Things that somehow come naturally to people who go to school in the suburbs and have parents who are culturally assimilated.” I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had “sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble.” This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: **Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge “about social norms and propriety” had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.**

We can compare

>“The loudest duck gets shot” is a Chinese proverb. “The nail that sticks out gets hammered down” is a Japanese one. Its Western correlative: “**The squeaky wheel gets the grease.**"

Yang finishes his article with

>**we will need more people with the same kind of defiance, willing to push themselves into the spotlight and to make some noise, to beat people up, to seduce women, to make mistakes, to become entrepreneurs, to stop doggedly pursuing official paper emblems attesting to their worthiness, to stop thinking those scraps of paper will secure anyone’s happiness, and to dare to be interesting.**

#### Academic Freedom
Nietzsche's On the Future of Educational Institutions
>Up until now, we have always believed that the purpose of the gymnasium was to prepare students for the university. This preparation was meant to make us independent enough to enjoy the extraordinary freedom of a university student - for no one in any sphere of life today is given as much freedom of choice and action as a student

>The individual must learn to delight in in having his own goals and views of his own, so that he can walk without crutches later

*How are your students connected to the university system?* Nietzsche asks. By attending lectures, listening and writing. This results in the students being *attached to the university by a kind of umbilical cord*.

<i>**it** makes demands, **it** legislates, **it** passes judgment</i>. The university becomes the higher authority, the arbitrator.

<i>Oh happy age, when the young and wise are educated enough to teach **themselves** how to walk!</i>

In modern times we find that students given lots of non-academic freedom. Most living away from parents in halls with other students. Old enough to
