title: The Teleology of Education
---
I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what we're doing.

This is a very opened ended question and also very difficult to answer. In some ways this is a positive things. As everyone is different, education is something everyone will participate in differently.

### Extra-curricular

Pedigree by Lauren Rivera [[1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0175F6HQ8)] talks about how 'elite students' get 'elite jobs'.

>... students from less privileged families are more likely to believe that extracurricular activities are irrelevant to their job prospects because what employers really care about are grades, tangible skills, and prior employment experiences and invest their time accordingly.

I've noticed this to be true at Imperial. Those who we're privately educated were more likely to participate in extra-curricular activities.

>Ironically, working-class students’ focus on academics (rather than social and extracurricular activities) while in school constrains, not expands, the types of jobs and incomes available to them when they graduate.

In the [FT review](https://www.ft.com/content/39628abc-ff2d-11e4-84b2-00144feabdc0) of the book, the review states

>In theory, this “pedigree” is meant to reflect individual merit and talent; in practice, though, it is hard for students to engage in extracurricular activity unless they come from an elite background to start with. Of course, some non-elite students manage to do this. But **a private high school, full of privileged kids, tends to provide a more supportive background than a public institution, even a highly competitive school**.

>“**Working-class students are more likely to enter college with the notion that the purpose of higher education is learning in the classrooms**, and invest their time and energy accordingly,” Rivera observes. “But the [fact that] these **students focus on academic rather than extra-curriculum pursuits adversely affects their job prospects**,” she adds, describing how time and again the people interviewing candidates for jobs made decisions based on subjective issues such as whether a candidate had “polish”, “breadth” — and “pedigree”.

### Asian-American Culture
Paper Tigers by Wesley Yang [[2](https://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/)] is a fantastic article. When analysing western culture, it's very useful to get opinions from those raised in different cultures.

Yang has the following feelings on the culture of Asian-American immigrants.

>Let me summarize my feelings toward Asian values: Fuck filial piety. Fuck grade-grubbing. Fuck Ivy League mania. Fuck deference to authority. Fuck humility and hard work. Fuck harmonious relations. Fuck sacrificing for the future. Fuck earnest, striving middle-class servility.

Yang interview a fellow Asian-American Jefferson Mao, who described himself as:

>“I got good grades and I love literature and I want to be a writer and an intellectual; at the same time, I’m the first person in my family to go to college, my parents don’t speak English very well, and we don’t own the apartment in Flushing that we live in. I mean, I’m proud of my parents and my neighborhood and what I perceive to be my artistic potential or whatever, but sometimes I feel like I’m jumping the gun a generation or two too early.”

Mao attended Stuyvesant High School, where he noticed:

>Mao began to study the racially inflected social hierarchies at Stuyvesant, where, in a survey undertaken by the student newspaper this year, slightly more than half of the respondents reported that their friends came from within their own ethnic group. His attention focused on the mostly white (and Manhattan-dwelling) group whose members seemed able to manage the crushing workload while still remaining socially active. **“The general gist of most high-school movies is that the pretty cheerleader gets with the big dumb jock, and the nerd is left to bide his time in loneliness. But at some point in the future,” he says, “the nerd is going to rule the world, and the dumb jock is going to work in a carwash.**

>**“At Stuy, it’s completely different: If you looked at the pinnacle, the girls and the guys are not only good-looking and socially affable, they also get the best grades and star in the school plays and win election to student government. It all converges at the top. It’s like training for high society.** It was jarring for us Chinese kids. You got the sense that you had to study hard, but it wasn’t enough.”

>Mao was becoming clued in to the fact that **there was another hierarchy behind the official one that explained why others were getting what he never had — “a high-school sweetheart” figured prominently on this list — and that this mysterious hierarchy was going to determine what happened to him in life.** “You realize there are things you really don’t understand about courtship or just acting in a certain way. Things that somehow come naturally to people who go to school in the suburbs and have parents who are culturally assimilated.” I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had “sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble.” This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: **Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge “about social norms and propriety” had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.**

Later in the article Yang compares Eastern and western proverbs.

>“The loudest duck gets shot” is a Chinese proverb. “The nail that sticks out gets hammered down” is a Japanese one. Its Western correlative: “**The squeaky wheel gets the grease.**"

In the west, standing out is a great thing. It is rewarded.

### Academic Freedom
Nietzsche did a series of five lectures of education. Called *On the Future of Educational Institutions*, it took the form of an overhead conversation between a  philosophy professor and one of his students.

>Up until now, we have always believed that **the purpose of the gymnasium was to prepare students for the university**. This preparation was meant to make us independent enough to enjoy the extraordinary freedom of a university student - for no one in any sphere of life today is given as much freedom of choice and action as a student

I agree with Nietzsche's statement that students have a greater amount of freedom than anyone else. Currently, students are given lots of non-academic freedom - most are living away from family in halls.

Nietzsche asks *How are your students connected to the university system?* In a soliloquy, he responds that students learn by attending lectures, listening and writing. This actually means the students have very little academic freedom. The students are *attached to the university by a kind of umbilical cord*.

Nietzsche proclaims how <i>**it** [the university] makes demands, **it** legislates, **it** passes judgment</i>. The university becomes the higher authority, the arbitrator.

In this sense there is less academic freedom, even today I believe this will be true. However I do believe that Nietzsche overstates the importance of the university. As Nietzsche himself states

<i>Oh happy age, when the young and wise are educated enough to teach **themselves** how to walk!</i>

The very best will self teach. We live in a world where self teaching in entirely possible and practical. For most of history, scientists did not depend on a university. Many where wealthy and self funded. The most valuable asset of modern universities is the freedom they give to students to spend their time as they wish.

I feel Nietzsche's lectures were more political than philosophical and didn't really explore the purpose of education or provide some ideas for what education should become.

### Going into Industry

> Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in **fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers** like management consulting and investment banking.

Of those [who have graduated](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/administration-and-support-services/careers-service/public/resources/dlhe/ug-tables/Physics-tables.pdf) from Imperial Physics (my course), typically >25% go into finance, ~20% go into tech and ~10% go into consulting. All elite jobs. About 45% go into further study.

Although I am a major critic of lemming-like behaviour, I often behave go with the crowd with lack of thought. It affects everything from what I wear to what I want to do. Some examples

* A good friend of mine family owned a bread maker. The bread was fantastic. I decided I would like one. So I bought one - the cheapest one available. It was bad, the bread was horrific and I only used it once or twice. A complete waste of ~ £50.
* The same good friend of mine also owned a very nice coat. I decided I wanted one, it cost ~ £150. I never wear it. I am often embarrassed to wear it.

The truth is whenever I do something because a group decides it's valuable, I always end up regretting it. I have an internal desire to be different from others, and copying the group doesn't work.

#### You Are Your Job

In Fight Club, Brad Pitt's character famously says

> You are not your job.

This is wrong. Your job is an integral part of you. It is how you meaningfully contribute to society. As Thiel contributes

> At college, model students obsessively hedge their futures by assembling a suite of exotic and minor skills. Every university believes in “excellence,” and hundred- page course catalogs arranged alphabetically according to arbitrary departments of knowledge seem designed to reassure you that “it doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do it well.” That is completely false. **It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future**.

#### Greater Income

In Tyler & Cowen's book [Talent](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1250275814/), they look at income inequality and educational level, finding that

> If you look at the years 1980-2000, the main driver of rising income differences - which explains 75% of the variation - is whether the person has a college degree, no degree or a graduate degree. But for 2000-2017, when we look at the rise in income inequality, amount of education only explains 38% of the variation.

> In the latter period, most of the income inequality is seen in people *within* the same educational group. In other words, **simply being educated only gets you so far; the real returns are to your talent above and beyond your educational level**.

#### The Education of Unicorn Founders

The often told story is that education is useless and many 'great' entrepreneurs dropped out. This is not true. It is far more common for founders of unicorns (>$1bn val.) to be highly educated at prestigious universities.

We often focus on the outliers, eg Gates and Zuck, who have dropped out. Although very wealthy there are exceptions, not the rule. Their companies don't hire dropouts. It would be far better to complete college than drop out.

### Debt

I don't believe the student debt problem is that serious, especially in the UK.

### Marriage

 [Branko Milanovic's](https://quillette.com/2019/10/18/rich-like-me-how-assortative-mating-is-driving-income-inequality/)] article on modern dating and it's effect on income equality contains an amazing paragraph.

> Some ten years ago, I found myself in an after-dinner conversation, lubricated by wine, with an American who had been educated at an Ivy League college and was then teaching in Europe. As our conversation drifted toward matters of life, marriage and children, I was initially surprised by his statement that whoever he had married, the outcome in terms of where they lived, what type of house they owned, what kind of holidays and entertainment they would enjoy, and even what colleges their children would attend would be practically the same. His reasoning was as follows: “**When I went to [Ivy League institution], I knew that I would marry a woman I met there. Women also knew the same thing. We all knew that our pool of desirable marriage candidates would never be as vast again. And then whomever I married would be a specimen of the same genre: They were all well-educated, smart women who came from the same social class, read the same novels and newspapers, dressed the same, had the same preferences about restaurants, hiking, places to live, cars to drive and people to see, as well about how to take care of the kids and what schools they should attend. It really made almost no difference socially whom among them I married.**”

Bryan Caplan's book [The Case Against Education](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0691196451/) gives a rather nihilistic explanation for expensive private schools.

> "the marriage market is probably the strongest reason to pay for expensive private schools. Going to Harvard may not get you a better job but almost certainly puts you in an exclusive dating pool for life"
