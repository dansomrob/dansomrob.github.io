title: The Teleology of School
---
I've begun thinking heavily about the teleology of university. This means instead of thinking in terms of cause and effect we now think of the **purpose** of what we're doing.

This is a very opened ended question and also very difficult to answer. In some ways this is a positive things. As everyone is different, education is something everyone will participate in differently.

<h4>Educational Experience of Founders</h4>

The often told story is that education is useless and many 'great' entrepreneurs dropped out. This is not true. It is far more common for founders of unicorns (>$1bn val.) to be highly educated at prestigious universities.

The Thiel fellowship gave students $200,000 to drop out of college and start heir own business. By and large it was a failure.

<h4>Extra-curricular</h4>

Pedigree by Lauren Rivera [[1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0175F6HQ8)] talks about how 'elite students' get 'elite jobs'.

>... students from less privileged families are more likely to believe that extracurricular activities are irrelevant to their job prospects because what employers really care about are grades, tangible skills, and prior employment experiences and invest their time accordingly.

I've noticed this to be true at Imperial. Those who we're privately educated we're more likely to participate in extra-curricular activities.

>Ironically, working-class students’ focus on academics (rather than social and extracurricular activities) while in school constrains, not expands, the types of jobs and incomes available to them when they graduate.

<h4>Asian-American Culture</h4>
Paper Tigers by Wesley Yang [[2](https://nymag.com/news/features/asian-americans-2011-5/)] is a fantastic article. When analysing western culture, it's very useful to get opinions from those raised in different cultures.

Yang has the following feelings on the culture of Asian-American immigrants.

>Let me summarize my feelings toward Asian values: Fuck filial piety. Fuck grade-grubbing. Fuck Ivy League mania. Fuck deference to authority. Fuck humility and hard work. Fuck harmonious relations. Fuck sacrificing for the future. Fuck earnest, striving middle-class servility.

Yang interview a fellow Asian-American Jefferson Mao, who described himself as:

>“I got good grades and I love literature and I want to be a writer and an intellectual; at the same time, I’m the first person in my family to go to college, my parents don’t speak English very well, and we don’t own the apartment in Flushing that we live in. I mean, I’m proud of my parents and my neighborhood and what I perceive to be my artistic potential or whatever, but sometimes I feel like I’m jumping the gun a generation or two too early.”

Mao attended Stuyvesant High School, where he noticed:

>Mao began to study the racially inflected social hierarchies at Stuyvesant, where, in a survey undertaken by the student newspaper this year, slightly more than half of the respondents reported that their friends came from within their own ethnic group. His attention focused on the mostly white (and Manhattan-dwelling) group whose members seemed able to manage the crushing workload while still remaining socially active. **“The general gist of most high-school movies is that the pretty cheerleader gets with the big dumb jock, and the nerd is left to bide his time in loneliness. But at some point in the future,” he says, “the nerd is going to rule the world, and the dumb jock is going to work in a carwash.**

>**“At Stuy, it’s completely different: If you looked at the pinnacle, the girls and the guys are not only good-looking and socially affable, they also get the best grades and star in the school plays and win election to student government. It all converges at the top. It’s like training for high society.** It was jarring for us Chinese kids. You got the sense that you had to study hard, but it wasn’t enough.”

>Mao was becoming clued in to the fact that **there was another hierarchy behind the official one that explained why others were getting what he never had — “a high-school sweetheart” figured prominently on this list — and that this mysterious hierarchy was going to determine what happened to him in life.** “You realize there are things you really don’t understand about courtship or just acting in a certain way. Things that somehow come naturally to people who go to school in the suburbs and have parents who are culturally assimilated.” I pressed him for specifics, and he mentioned that he had visited his white girlfriend’s parents’ house the past Christmas, where the family had “sat around cooking together and playing Scrabble.” This ordinary vision of suburban-American domesticity lingered with Mao: **Here, at last, was the setting in which all that implicit knowledge “about social norms and propriety” had been transmitted. There was no cram school that taught these lessons.**

We can compare

>“The loudest duck gets shot” is a Chinese proverb. “The nail that sticks out gets hammered down” is a Japanese one. Its Western correlative: “The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

Yang finishes his article with

>we will need more people with the same kind of defiance, willing to push themselves into the spotlight and to make some noise, to beat people up, to seduce women, to make mistakes, to become entrepreneurs, to stop doggedly pursuing official paper emblems attesting to their worthiness, to stop thinking those scraps of paper will secure anyone’s happiness, and to dare to be interesting.
