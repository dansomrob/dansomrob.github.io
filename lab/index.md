# Personal Physics Lab!

I need a new project! So I want to build my conduct own physics experiments!

Currently I'm completing our first year lab project, we're exploring the properties of electrons produced via thermionic emission.

So, let's steal some equipment from labs, build our own and start building cool sh*t.
