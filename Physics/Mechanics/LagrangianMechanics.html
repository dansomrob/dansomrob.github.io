    A New Value Of A System
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's invest a new value, called the 'liveliness' of the system. This value
    can be found by:
    <br>
    \[Liveliness = Kenetic \; Energy - Potential \; Energy\]
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>A particle with a high ‘liveliness’ will have a high velocity, but it cannot go much faster.
      <li>A particle with low ‘liveliness’ will have a high velocity, but it can go faster.
      <li>A particle with negative ‘liveliness’ will have a low velocity, but it can go faster.
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
    \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
