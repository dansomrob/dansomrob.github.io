    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's invest a new value, called the 'liveliness' of the system. This value
    can be found by:
    <br>
    \[Liveliness = Kenetic \; Energy - Potential \; Energy\]
    <i>
      A particle with a high ‘liveliness’ will have a high velocity, but it cannot go much faster.<br>
      A particle with low ‘liveliness’ will have a high velocity, but it can go faster.<br>
      A particle with negative ‘liveliness’ will have a low velocity, but it can go faster.<br><br>
    </i>
    The ‘liveliness’ of a system give us a rough understanding of the current velocity and potential future velocity.
    <br>
    \[𝐿(𝑥,𝑣)=𝑇(𝑣)−𝑉(𝑥)\]
    Where L(x,v) is the ‘liveliness’, T(v) is the kinetic energy and V(x) is the potential energy.<br><br>
    And now replace the word 'liveliness' with lagrnagian and we can properly go exploring.
