  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's invest a new value, called the 'liveliness' of the system. This value
    can be found by:
    <br>
    \[Liveliness = Kenetic \; Energy - Potential \; Energy\]
    <i>
      A particle with a high ‘liveliness’ will have a high velocity, but it cannot go much faster.<br>
      A particle with low ‘liveliness’ will have a high velocity, but it can go faster.<br>
      A particle with negative ‘liveliness’ will have a low velocity, but it can go faster.<br><br>
    </i>
    The ‘liveliness’ of a system give us a rough understanding of the current velocity and potential future velocity.
    <br>
    \[𝐿(𝑥,𝑣)=𝑇(𝑣)−𝑉(𝑥)\]
    Where L(x,v) is the ‘liveliness’, T(v) is the kinetic energy and V(x) is the potential energy.<br><br>
    And now replace the word 'liveliness' with lagranagian and we can properly go exploring.

  <h2>
    The Action of A System
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's imagine a particle moving from point A to point B, if we cacluated the lagrangian at every
    time step and sum them we get the Action of the system.
    \[\mathcal{A}=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} Ldt\]
    Or, written a bit nicer (and assuming V(x)=mgx):
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - mgx\]
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Principle of Least Action
  </h2>
  <p>
  The Universal law of nature is very simple, it's:
  <br><br><strong>
    Nature is lazy.
  <br><br></strong>
    The big issue in physics is how to write this down mathematically. This was first noticed by ...<br>
    In classical mechanics we say that the ball will take the path with the lowest action(we ain't doing
    quantum yet...).
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Derivation of the Euler-Lagrange Equtaion
  </h2>
  <p>
    We need to use the calculus of variations, we do this by adding a very small value to the position and velocity.
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} 𝐿((x+h),(v+\dot{h}))\]
    Then using the Taylor Expansion we can find that:
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} 𝐿(x,v)+\frac{h}{1!}\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\frac{\dot{h}}{1!}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}+\]
