  <h1>Lagrangian Mechanics</h1>
  <h2>Fundemental Concepts</h2>
  <h3>Kinematics</h3>
  <p>
    Let's begin by looking at
  <p>
  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <p>
    <i>A particle is given an ipulse giving an inital velocity of \(x_0\). It then has an
      acceleration given by \(a=-bv\) where \(b\) is a constant.<br>
      Obtain an expression for \(v(t)\).</i><br><br>
    So, let's begin by writing the equation for acceleration as
    \[\frac{dv}{dt}=-bv\]
    If we divide by \(v\) and multiply by \(dt\) we get
    \[\frac{dv}{v}=-bdt\]
    Now, if we intergrate both sides we get
    \[\int {\frac{dv}{v}}=\int {-b\,dt}\]
    \[ln\,v=-bt\]
    And then raising everything to the power of \(e\)
    \[v=v_0e^{-bt}\]
    Boom! Solved! This is known as separation of variables. Kinda important.
  </p>
  <h3>Force and Potential</h3>
  <p>
    It's important to note a key relationship between the potential of a particle and the force it experiences.
    \[F=-\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\]
    Beautiful.
  </p>
  <h2>Configuration Space</h2>
  <p>
    When exploring lagrangian mechanics we are in configuration space, not physical space.<br><br>
    But what is configuration space?<br><br>
  <h2>Fermat's Principle</h2>
  <p>
    Fermat's priciple states that<br><br>
    "<i>Nature operates by means and ways that are easiest and fastest.</i>"<br><br>
    Or, written more simply<br><br>
    <strong>Nature is lazy</strong><br><br>
    This simple idea will allow us to derive equations of motion for any system (including quantum!).<br><br>
    Let's look at a good example of this - Snell's Law.<br><br>
  <h2>The Lagrangian</h2>
  <p>
    \[L(x,v)=T(v)-V(x)\]
    Where \(T(v)\) is the kinetic energy and \(v(x)\) is the potential energy.<br>
    Therefore, for a one-dimensional partical when \(V(x)=mgx\) is
    \[L(x,v)=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-mgx\]
  </p>
  <h2>Action</h2>
  <p>
    \[\mathcal{A}=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} L\,dt\]
  </p>
  <h2>The Euler-Lagrange Equation</h2>
  <p>
    Let's derive the priciple of least action.<br>
    Let's start from the equation for action.
    \[\mathcal{A}=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} L\,dt\]
    Next, we need to use the calculus of variations - by adding a very small value to the position and velocity.
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} ùêø((x+h),(v+\dot{h}))\]
    Then using the <a href="/Maths/Mathematics/Taylor">Taylor Expansion</a> we can find that:
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} ùêø(x,v)+\frac{h}{1!}\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\frac{\dot{h}}{1!}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}+...\]
    We can keep on going for higher powers but this isn't important.<br><br>
    This is because when \(h\lt\lt1\) we find that \(h^1\lt\lt h^2\) and \(h^1\) is bigger than all higher powers of \(h\)<br><br>
    Therfore, the first order terms of the expansion are equal to zero.
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\dot{h}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\]
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\frac{dh}{ht}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\]
    Now we can use intergration by parts to simplify the second part of the above equation.
    \[\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{dh}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}=h\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\]
    For the path of least action, h will tend to zero. Therefore we can say that
    \[\lim_{h\to 0} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = 0\]
    This means our intergration by parts is equal to
    \[\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{dh}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}=-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\]
    Subbing this we find that
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\]
    If we factorise out the h
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\biggr)\]
    It's important to note that h can be any value. Therefore for the above to be true we have to assume that
    \[\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0\]
    And this is the Euler-Lagrange equation. Woohoo!

    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's invest a new value, called the 'liveliness' of the system. This value
    can be found by:
    <br>
    \[Liveliness = Kinetic \; Energy - Potential \; Energy\]
    <i>
      A particle with a high ‚Äòliveliness‚Äô will have a high velocity, but it cannot go much faster.<br>
      A particle with low ‚Äòliveliness‚Äô will have a high velocity, but it can go faster.<br>
      A particle with negative ‚Äòliveliness‚Äô will have a low velocity, but it can go faster.<br><br>
    </i>
    The ‚Äòliveliness‚Äô of a system give us a rough understanding of the current velocity and potential future velocity.
    <br>
    \[ùêø(ùë•,ùë£)=ùëá(ùë£)‚àíùëâ(ùë•)\tag{1.1}\]
    Where L(x,v) is the ‚Äòliveliness‚Äô, T(v) is the kinetic energy and V(x) is the potential energy.<br><br>
    And now replace the word 'liveliness' with lagranagian and we can properly go exploring.
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Action of A System
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's imagine a particle moving from point A to point B, if we cacluated the lagrangian at every
    time step and sum them we get the Action of the system.
    \[\mathcal{A}=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} Ldt\tag{1.2}\]
    Or, written a bit nicer (and assuming \(V(x)=mgx\)):
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - mgx\tag{1.3}\]
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Principle of Least Action
  </h2>
  <p>
  The Universal law of nature is very simple, it's:
  <br><br><strong>
    Nature is lazy.
  <br><br></strong>
    The big issue in physics is how to write this down mathematically. This was first noticed by ...<br>
    In classical mechanics we say that the ball will take the path with the lowest action (we ain't doing
    quantum yet...).
  </p>
  <h2>
    The Derivation of the Euler-Lagrange Equtaion
  </h2>
  <p>
    We need to use the calculus of variations, we do this by adding a very small value to the position and velocity.
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} ùêø((x+h),(v+\dot{h}))\]
    Then using the Taylor Expansion we can find that:
    \[Action=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} ùêø(x,v)+\frac{h}{1!}\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\frac{\dot{h}}{1!}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}+...\]
    We can keep on going for higher powers but this isn't important. The only part which is important is the first order,
    which will be equal to zero.
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\dot{h}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\]
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}+\frac{dh}{ht}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\]
    Now we can use intergration by parts to simplify the second part of the above equation.
    \[\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{dh}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}=h\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\]
    For the path of least action, h will tend to zero. Therefore we can say that
    \[\lim_{h\to 0} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = 0\]
    This means our intergration by parts is equal to
    \[\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{dh}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}=-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\]
    Subbing this we find that
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\]
    If we factorise out the h
    \[0=\int_{t_0}^{t_1} h\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)\biggr)\]
    It's important to note that h can be any value. Therefore for the above to be true we have to assume that
    \[\frac{d}{dt}\biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial v}\biggr)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=0\tag{1.4}\]
    And this is the Euler-Lagrange equation. Woohoo!
  </p>
  <h2>
    Pendulum Example
  </h2>
  <p>
    Let's image a simple pendulum desibed as below
  </p>
  <img src="" height="">
  <p>
    We'll begin by asuming we'll be using polar cordinates for this example (the euler-lagrange equation works<br>
    in both cartesian and polar coordinates, see later). Let's also note that \(v(x)=mgh\) and \(T(v)=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\)<br>
    Therefore we need to trasform the height and velocity into polar cordinates.
  </p>
  \[h=l-lcos\theta\]
  \[v=l\omega\]
  <p>
    As \(l\) is constant this works. Note that for if we let \(v(x)=mgh\) Then the lagrangian equals:
    \[L=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}-mgh\]
    If we sub in our new equations for h and x into our lagrangian we get:
    \[L=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^{2}l^{2}-mgl+mglcos\theta\]
    Then using the euler-lagrange equation we find that
    \[m\dot{\omega}l^{2}+mglsin\theta=0\]
    Dividing by m and l
    \[\dot{\omega}l+gsin\theta=0\]
    Cheeky rearrange
    \[\dot{\omega}=\frac{gsin\theta}{l}\]
    And if we approached this from a newtonian perspective we would get the same answer.
  </p>
    <h2>
      Configuration Space
    </h2>
    <p>
      One thing we've ignored so far in our exploration of the lagrangeian has been the mathematical arena<br>
      we're playing in. Newtonian mechanics works in physical space.  Lagrangian mechanics works in<br>
      configuration space.<br><br>
      <strong>So what the hell is configuration space?</strong><br><br>
      Let's imagine a 1 dimensional system with 2 point particles on. We can use 2 1d vectors to descibe this system.<br>
      However this means we have to solve 2 equations! And we're physicists! We ain't doing that! So instead we're<br>
      going to use 1 2d vector to desibe our system.<br><br>
      If effect what we're doing is turning multiple lower dimensional systems into 1 higher dimesional system.
