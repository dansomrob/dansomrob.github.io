    <i>Cellular automata may be viewed as computers, in which data represented by initial<br>
      configurations is processed by time evolution.</i><br><br>
      Steven Wolfram<br><br>
      Cellular automata are simple mathematical models where we have a bunch of cells which can exist in \(k\) states.<br><br>
      Let's begin by looking at cellular automata when \(k=2\), here taking either a value of 0 or 1.<br><br>
      We can view 0 as being dead (white cell) and 1 and being alive (black cell).

    Now this doesn't really do much.
    So let's add a time dimension (we're only going to look at one dimension automata for now).
    Lets us the following equation
    \[a_i^{t+1}=a_{i-1}^{t}+a_{i+1}^t\quad{\text{mod 2}}\]
    Here, \(t\) is the time dimension, \(t+1\) is the row beneath \(t\).<br><br>
    \(i\) represents the dimension of the cell, with \(t-1\) to the left and \(t+1\) to the right.<br><br>
    Also note that \(a\) represnt the value of that cell. In this example \(a, i, t\) are all discrete.<br><br>
    If we start with just one 'alive' cell, this equation gives us

    Now, how do we name this rule?<br><br>
    We're going to use this system:
