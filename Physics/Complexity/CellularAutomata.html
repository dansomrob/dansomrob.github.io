    <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
  <p>
    Cellular automata are simple mathematical models where we have a bunch of cells which can exist in \(k\) states.<br><br>
    Let's begin by looking at cellular automata when \(k=2\), here taking either a value of 0 or 1.<br><br>
    We can view 0 as being dead (white cell) and 1 and being alive (black cell).

    Now this doesn't really do much.
    So let's add a time dimension (we're only going to look at one dimension automata for now).<br><br>
    Lets us the following equation
    \[a_i^{t+1}=a_{i-1}^{t}+a_{i+1}^t\quad{\text{mod 2}}\]
    Here, \(t\) is the time dimension, \(t+1\) is the row beneath \(t\).<br><br>
    \(i\) represents the dimension of the cell, with \(t-1\) to the left and \(t+1\) to the right.<br><br>
    Also note that \(a\) represnt the value of that cell. In this example \(a, i, t\) are all discrete.<br><br>
    But what about that weird \(\text{mod 2}\) thingy!<br><br>
    It means to take the remainder after the sum has been divided by 2.<br><br>
    If we start with just one 'alive' cell, this equation gives us

    Now, how do we name this rule?<br><br>
    We're going to use this system:
    <br><br><img src="/Physics/Complexity/Fig3.PNG" height="250px"><br><br>
    We take the binary number of the rule and the find the base-10 number from it.<br>
    This means that the rule we've seen so far is rule 90. Simple.
