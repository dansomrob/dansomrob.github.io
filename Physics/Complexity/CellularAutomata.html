  <h1>Cellular Automata</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Cellular automata are discrete models of <a href="/Maths/Mathematics/Diff_Eqn">differential equations</a>
    where we have a bunch of cells which can exist in \(k\) states.<br><br>
    Let's begin by looking at cellular automata when \(k=2\), here taking either a value of 0 or 1.<br><br>
    We can view 0 as being dead (white cell) and 1 and being alive (black cell).

    Now this doesn't really do much.
    So let's add a time dimension (we're only going to look at one dimension automata for now).<br><br>
    Lets us the following equation
    \[a_i^{t+1}=a_{i-1}^{t}+a_{i+1}^t\quad{\text{mod 2}}\]
    Here, \(t\) is the time dimension, \(t+1\) is the row beneath \(t\).<br>
    \(i\) represents the dimension of the cell, with \(t-1\) to the left and \(t+1\) to the right.<br>
    Also note that \(a\) represnt the value of that cell. In this example \(a, i, t\) are all discrete.<br>
    But what about that weird \(\text{mod 2}\) thingy!<br><br>
    It means to take the remainder after the sum has been divided by 2 - it's known as <i>modulo 2</i>.<br><br>
    If we start with just one 'alive' cell, this equation gives us
    <br><br><img src="/Physics/Complexity/Fig2.PNG" height="300px"><br><br>
    Now, how do we name this rule?<br><br>
    We're going to use this system:
    <br><br><img src="/Physics/Complexity/Fig3.PNG" height="250px"><br><br>
    We take the binary number of the rule and the find the base-10 number from it.<br>
    This means that the rule we've seen so far is rule 90. Simple.
  </p>
  <h2>Classes of Cellular Automata</h2>
  <p>
    Broadly, we can define cellular automata into 4 major classes, they are:<br><br>
    -Evolution leads to a homegeneous state.<br>
    -Evolution leads to a stable (periodic) strutures.<br>
    -Evolution leads to chaotic patterns.<br>
    -Exolution leads to complex, long-lived structures.<br><br>
    Class 1 will eventually evolve to a state where all cells have the same value. Ther're rather boring.<br><br>
    Class 2 will evolve into repeating patterns with a time period \(t\).<br><br>
    Class 3 will evolve ... <br><br>
    Class 4 will evolve ...<br><br>
  </p>
  <h2>Binomial Coefficients</h2>
  <p>
    Let's begin by looking at pascal's triangle. Or indeed the binomial coefficients found by the expansion of
    \[(1+x)^n\]
    If we do this ( which is equivilent to rule 90) and then take the \(modulo\;2\) we get:<br><br>
    <br><br><img src="/Physics/Complexity/BinCo.PNG" height="180px"><br><br>
    This is the same as our results from rule 90.<br><br>
  </p>
  <h2>Density</h2>
  <p>
    We can use the density \(p_{\tau}\) of cellular automata to find any subtle paterns the rules generate.<br>
    Initally lets simple look at the the desnity of value 1.
    \[p_1=\frac{\#_1(R)}{\#_0(R)+\#_1(R)}\]
    where \(\#_1(R)\) is the number of sites with value 1 and \(\#_0(R)\) the number of sites with value 0.<br>
    For example when \(R=182\) we find that
    \[p_1=\frac{\#_1(182)}{\#_0(182)+\#_1(182)}\]
    \[p_1=\frac{5}{3+5}\]
    \[p_1=\frac{5}{8}\]
    This allows us to read a string of values at time \(\tau\) and find the density.<br>
    We can then plot a density-time graph which shows us
    <br><br><img src="/Physics/Complexity/Density.PNG" height="300px"><br><br>
    In this graph the inital densities were 0.2 in random inital conditions.<br><br>
    We reach an equalibrium density when
    \[\frac{dp_{\tau}}{d\tau}=0\]
    Note that although this is a good indictor of class 1 we cannot say for definite.
  </p>
  <h2>Entropy</h2>
  <p>
    From the section on desntiy, we can see that cellular automata can cause random inital conditions<br>
    to form into more ordered states.
    The entropy of a system can be found by
    \[S=\sum_i p_i\log_2 p_i\]
    where \(p_i\) is the probabilty of state \(i\)<br><br>
    For a finite cellular automata of \(N\) cells we know that there are \(2^N\) possible states.
  </p>
  <h3>Cantor Sets</h3>
  <p>
    Lets look at \(N=10\) cellular automata. We know that there are \(2^{10}=1024\) possible states.<br>
    Turing evolution we can have reversible laws and irreversible laws. So far all the laws are irreversible<br>
    (see later for further exploration). We know this as mutliple states can evolve into the same state.<br>
    This makes the law irreversible as we cannot tell which state we came from. There will also be some states
    which are impossible to obtain.<br><br>
    If we look at this diagramatically we can make cantor sets with all 1024 states.<br>
    We can then remove the states which are impossible to obtain. Plot this againt time.

  </p>
  <h3>Reversability</h3>
  <p>
    At the beginning I talked about how cellular automata are dialogs of differential equations.<br>
    We can analogise first order differential equations and cellular automta that only look at the<br>
    previous time step. As a result these are irreversible. Second order differential equations<br>
    can be viewed as cellular automata which look at the previous two time steps.
    \[a_i^{t+1}=f(a_{i}^t)\]
    \[a_i^{t+1}=f(a_{i}^t+a_{i}^{t-1})\]
