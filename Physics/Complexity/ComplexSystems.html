  <h1>Complex Systems</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The main difference we'll be looking at in complex systems is doing it through differential equations.<br>
    In <a href="/Physics/Complexity/CellularAutomata">cellular automata</a> we are looking at discrete values
    of differnetial equations - usually spaceially apart.<br>
    We are also going to look beyond the mathematics at some of the real world appliactions - mainly work
    from Scheffer!<br><br>
    We will need good knowledge of <a href="/Maths/Matrices">matrices</a> while exploring.
  </p>
  <h2>System's Theory</h2>
  <p>
    There are 2 types of system: open and closed. A closed system has no energy input or output. An open system<br>
    has an energy input and/or output.
  </p>
  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <p>
    \[\Rightarrow \text{Linear}\qquad f(z)=A\cdot z\]
    \[\Rightarrow \text{Nonlinear}\qquad f(z)\]
    \[\Rightarrow \text{First Order}\qquad \dot z=f(z(t))\]
    \[\Rightarrow \text{Second Order}\qquad \dot z=f(z(t),\dot z(t))\]
  </p>
  <h2>Dynamic Systems</h2>
  <p>
    A dynamic system has the form
    \[\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = \dot z = f(z)\]
  <p>
  <h3>State Augmentation</h3>
  <p>
    Let's look at the eqution for a spring with fricion.
    \[\ddot x(t) = -kx(t) - b\dot x(t)\]
    This is a second order differential equation.<br>
    However if we define the state \(z(t)\) as
    \[z(t)=\begin{bmatrix}\dot x(t) \\ x(t)\end{bmatrix}\]
    Then we can rewrite this equation as
    \[\begin{bmatrix}\ddot x(t) \\ \dot x(t)\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-b & -k\\1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}\dot x(t) \\ x(t)\end{bmatrix}\]
    If \(A\) is defined as
    \[A=\begin{bmatrix}-b & -k\\1 & 0\end{bmatrix}\]
    We get
    \[\dot z(t)=A\cdot z(t)\]
    Which is a first order equation!<br>
    This is called <i>state augmentation</i> and allows us to simplfy some harder differential equations.<br><br>
    Looking at the second order equation
    \[\ddot y = By\]
    we can define \(z(t)\) as
    \[z(t)=\begin{bmatrix}\dot y(t)\\y(t)\end{bmatrix}\]
    Which gives us
    \[\dot z(t) = \begin{bmatrix}0 & B\\I & 0\end{bmatrix}\cdot z(t)\]
    A recast of a higher oder equation as a first order equation.
  </p>
  <h2>Linear Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Although almost now societal, ecological or natural systems are linear, however we need to develop<br>
    some important tool before we can attack nonlinear systems. Let's go.
  </p>
  <h3>Superposition</h3>
  <p>
    For a linear system we find that<br><br>
    <i>Average(System Responce(Input))=System Responce(Average(Input))</i><br><br>
    Now this doen't hold for most systems (eg. take a \(x^2\) graph) - but is true for all<br>
    linear systems.
  </p>
  <h3>Eigendecomposition</h3>
  <p>
    Many people learn the mechanics of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors but not much more than that.<br>
    Eigendecomposition takes a system and finds the <i>modes</i> of the system. Modes are unchanging<br>
    parts of the system - eg saddle points.<br><br>
    If we look at the eigenequation
    \[Av=\lambda v\]
    where \(A\) is a matrix, \(\lambda\) is the eigenvalue and \(v\) is the eigenvector.<br><br>
    If we apply a transformation \(A\) to a vector \(v\) and the direction of the vector<br>
    is the same before and after the transformation, we call it an <i>eigenvector</i>.<br>
    This eigenvector thougth may be scaled by a scalar (eg. twice as long - \(\lambda=2\))<br>
    we is called the <i>eigenvalue</i>.<br><br>
    It's important to note that for all <a href="/Maths/Matrices">diagonizable</a> linear systems we only have two behavours.<br>
    \(\Rightarrow\)For Real\(\lambda\) < 0    we have <i>stable</i> dynamics.<br>
    \(\Rightarrow\)For Real\(\lambda\) > 0    we have <i>unstable</i> dynamics.
  </p>
  <h3>Non-Normal Systems</h3>
  <h2>Bifurcations</h2>
  <h3>Slip n Stick : Hopf Bifurcations</h3>
  <p>
    Scrape your finger nails across the desk. The motion of your hand will be smooth and continous.<br>
    However, sound is to do with freqencies - ie. a very fast <i>tick, tick, tick</i> becomes a smooth tone.<br>
    If we were to zoom in and slow down time your finger tips we would see a slip and stick behaviour.<br><br>
    \(\Rightarrow\)a brief period of very fast motion<br>
    \(\Rightarrow\)a similar period of stationary behaviour.
