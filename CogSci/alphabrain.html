    <h2>Marginal Improvement</h2>
      <h3>Spectating in our Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Often when we look at the world we like to think we participate in our decisions. Untrue.<br>
        Normally we only spectate them.
      </p>
      <h4>Popcorn</h4>
      <p>
        Group of moviegoers. Half we given bucket of popcorn, other half given extra-large bucket<br>
        of popcorn. For these two groups, half were given fresh popcorn, other half given 14-day old<br>
        popcorn (later rated 2/10).<br><br>
        However, despite the differences in taste, all those with the extra-large bucket ate about 40%<br>
        more than those with the regular bucket.<br><br>
        In a rational world the only things that effect our decision to eat is hunger and enjoyment.<br>
        Seeing as crappy popcorn doesnt fufill these we can assume the decision to eat more is a<br>
        irrational decision. <i>The best way to go on a diet is the make your plate smaller</i>.
      </p>
      <h4>Organ Donation</h4>
      <p>
        Some european countries (<i>Denmark, Germany & UK</i>) have very low (~10%) organ donation rates while<br>
        other european countries (<i>Sweden, France & Austria</i>) have very high (~99%) organ donation rates.<br>
        Why?<br><br>

      <h3>Avoiding Mistakes</h3>
      <h4>Tennis</h4>
      <p>
        Let's look at the career of Novak Djokovic. Let's track his career by looking at matches won,<br>
          money earnt & position ranking.
        <img src="/CogSci/tennis1.png" height="150px"><br><br>
        It's important to note that Novak does not control any of these numbers. They are <strong>outcomes</strong>
        now inputs.<br><br>
        Now if we add in the number of points he has won we get a very different graph.
        <br><br><img src="/CogSci/tennis2.png" height="160px">
        Here the decision success rate is a <strong>input</strong>. Novak can control them.<br><br>
        It's vital we see that
        <br><br><img src="/CogSci/graph.png" height="250px"><br><br>
        A small increase in successfull decisions can lead to a big increase in success.<br>
        A margianal improvement leads to massive change.
