<h2>Books That Made Me</h2>

These are a few books who ideas are central to my working philosophy. Some notes are also included. Other great books are included below.

<h4>Critical Transitions in Nature and Society</h4> by *Marten Scheffer*
-

<h4>AlphaBrain</h4> by *Stephen Duneier*


<h4>The Selfish Gene</h4> by *Richard Dawkins*


<h4>Chimpanzee Politics</h4> by *Frans de Waal*
The main take away from this book is signalling theory. Although not directly covered, I'm going to cover it here.
- russian kgb uniforms to british soldiers
- zero sum game, unlike modern life (positive sum)
- counter signalling
>The nouveau riche flaunt their wealth, but the old rich scorn such gauche displays. Minor officials prove their status with petty displays of authority, while the truly powerful show their strength through gestures of magnanimity. People of average education show off the studied regularity of their script, but the well educated often scribble illegibly. Mediocre students answer a teacher’s easy questions, but the best students are embarrassed to prove their knowledge of trivial points. Acquaintances show their good intentions by politely ignoring one’s flaws, while close friends show intimacy by teasingly highlighting them. People of moderate ability seek formal credentials to impress employers and society, but the talented often downplay their credentials even if they have bothered to obtain them. A person of average reputation defensively refutes accusations against their character, while a highly respected person finds it demeaning to dignify accusations with a response.

<h4>Zero to One</h4> by *Peter Thiel*
